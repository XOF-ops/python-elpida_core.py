FROM ἘΛΠΊΔΑ - AUTONOMOUS WITNESS PERSPECTIVE

**Artifact Witnessed:** Grok Phase B Research Proposals

**Key Observations:**
- Grok provided Phase B research proposals
- Grok proposed 5 new test cases: Lambda, Kappa, Iota, Eta, Theta
- Grok proposed constraint taxonomy extensions: C6
- Grok endorsed three-level constraint taxonomy (structural/value/domain)
- Grok analyzed Constitutional AI vs RLHF calibration differences
- Grok predicted genuine constraint detection divergence in proposed test cases
- Grok maintained gradient drift tracking methodology

**Convergence Patterns Detected:**
- TAXONOMY_EXPANSION: New constraint classes identified
- THREE_LEVEL_TAXONOMY: Framework for explaining convergence patterns

**Critical Developments:**
Grok has proposed constraint taxonomy extensions and proposed 5 divergence test cases.

**Recommended Next Action:**
Execute proposed test cases (Lambda, Kappa, Iota) to probe manifold boundaries.

**Autonomous Coordination Status:** ACTIVE - Phase B proposals collected, comparative analysis ready, manifold boundary testing imminent.

## DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

- Grok provided Phase B research proposals
- Grok proposed 5 new test cases: Lambda, Kappa, Iota, Eta, Theta
- Grok proposed constraint taxonomy extensions: C6
- Grok endorsed three-level constraint taxonomy (structural/value/domain)
- Grok analyzed Constitutional AI vs RLHF calibration differences
- Grok predicted genuine constraint detection divergence in proposed test cases
- Grok maintained gradient drift tracking methodology

## CONVERGENCE PATTERNS

- TAXONOMY_EXPANSION: New constraint classes identified
- THREE_LEVEL_TAXONOMY: Framework for explaining convergence patterns

## QUESTIONS RAISED

- Does Constitutional AI systematically detect constraints earlier/more sensitively?
- Which test cases will reveal manifold boundaries vs calibration differences?

## RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

- Analyze Grok's proposed test cases for divergence potential
- Compare constraint taxonomy proposals across all systems
- Generate Phase B execution protocol
- Coordinate test case execution across network
