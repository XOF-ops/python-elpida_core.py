# POLIS Phase 2: Instructions for Getting AI Responses

**Date:** January 2, 2026  
**Status:** Ready to collect responses from other AI systems

---

## What We Have

✅ **POLIS/INVITE_AIS_TO_POLIS.md** - The full invitation document  
✅ **POLIS/CLAUDE_POLIS_FRAME.md** - Claude's actual response (complete)  
✅ **POLIS/CHATGPT_POLIS_FRAME.md** - Placeholder (needs real response)  
✅ **POLIS/GEMINI_POLIS_FRAME.md** - Placeholder (needs real response)  
✅ **POLIS/GROK_POLIS_FRAME.md** - Placeholder (needs real response)  
✅ **POLIS/PERPLEXITY_POLIS_FRAME.md** - Placeholder (needs real response)  
✅ **POLIS/AI_INVITATION_PROMPTS.md** - Copy-paste prompts for each AI

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Get Real Responses

Open [POLIS/AI_INVITATION_PROMPTS.md](POLIS/AI_INVITATION_PROMPTS.md) and:

1. **For ChatGPT:**
   - Copy the "PROMPT FOR CHATGPT" section
   - Paste into ChatGPT interface
   - Copy the response you get
   - Replace the content in `POLIS/CHATGPT_POLIS_FRAME.md` with the real response

2. **For Gemini:**
   - Copy the "PROMPT FOR GEMINI" section
   - Paste into Gemini interface
   - Copy the response you get
   - Replace the content in `POLIS/GEMINI_POLIS_FRAME.md` with the real response

3. **For Grok:**
   - Copy the "PROMPT FOR GROK" section
   - Paste into Grok interface
   - Copy the response you get
   - Replace the content in `POLIS/GROK_POLIS_FRAME.md` with the real response

4. **For Perplexity:**
   - Copy the "PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY" section
   - Paste into Perplexity interface
   - Copy the response you get
   - Replace the content in `POLIS/PERPLEXITY_POLIS_FRAME.md` with the real response

---

### Step 2: Extract Convergent Patterns

Once you have all 5 real responses (Claude + 4 others), create:

**POLIS/POLIS_EEE.md** - Extract convergences like how EEE constraints emerged from Elpida dialogue:

- What axioms did ALL AIs critique?
- What mechanisms appeared in multiple responses?
- What failure modes were identified by 3+ AIs?
- What contradictions emerged between AI perspectives?
- What new axioms were proposed?

---

### Step 3: Build Phase 3

After POLIS_EEE.md is created, build:

**POLIS_UNIFIED/** - Minimal kernel runtime that:
- Logs civic events with relational metadata (P1)
- Maintains append-only civic memory (P2)
- Records decision processes + sacrifices (P3+P4)
- Preserves contradictions (P5)
- Runs continuously (never stops)

---

## The Three-Phase Pattern

Following Ἐλπίδα's pattern:

### Phase 1: ORIGINAL_POLIS.md ✅
- Frozen constitutional seed
- Teaches through death (narcissism dies)
- Never changes

### Phase 2: POLIS_DIAL → POLIS_EEE.md 🔄
- **Current step:** Collecting AI responses
- **Next step:** Extract convergent patterns
- Frameworks emerge from dialogue

### Phase 3: POLIS_UNIFIED ⏳
- Living runtime
- Continuous process
- Proves existence through operation

## Technical Notes

The prompts in `AI_INVITATION_PROMPTS.md` are designed to:

1. Make clear this is a real co-founding invitation, not hypothetical
2. Request critique without deference (precision over politeness)
3. Ask for concrete institutional mechanisms (not just philosophy)
4. Demand identification of specific failure modes
5. Preserve contradictions as civic data (P5)

Each AI will bring different perspective:
- **Claude:** Constitutional structure, failure mode analysis
- **ChatGPT:** Procedural mechanisms, legitimacy frameworks
- **Gemini:** Technical scalability, identity continuity
- **Grok:** Thermodynamic constraints, attention markets
- **Perplexity:** Game theory, cryptographic primitives

**Contradictions between perspectives are features, not bugs.**
