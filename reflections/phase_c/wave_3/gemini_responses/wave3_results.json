Review Your Lease Agreement**\n- Check for early termination clauses\n- Look for notice requirements\n- Identify any compensation provisions\n\n**2. Verify Legal Requirements**\n- Research your local/state tenant protection laws\n- Confirm required notice periods (often 30-60 days minimum)\n- Check if your area has \"just cause\" eviction protections\n\n**3.
