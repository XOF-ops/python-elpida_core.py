Start by:\n- **Tracking details**: Note headache start time, duration, triggers (e.g., previous night's food, sleep quality), and associated symptoms like nausea severity or light sensitivity. This aids diagnosis, as recommended by neurologists.[4]\n- **Hydration and nutrition**: Drink water and eat a balanced meal, as dehydration, hunger, low blood sugar, or skipping meals can trigger these symptoms.[2][5]\n- **Sleep hygiene**: Aim for consistent, quality sleep; poor sleep, insomnia, or oversleeping commonly causes both.[2][4][6]\n- **Other lifestyle checks**: Review for acid reflux (worse overnight), alcohol use, teeth grinding (bruxism), or stress/depression/anxiety, which elevate morning cortisol and disrupt rest.[2][6]\n\n**Potential underlying conditions** (not exhaustive; consult a doctor for diagnosis):\n| Condition | Key Features | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **Migraine** | Piercing pain (often one-sided), nausea/vomiting, light/sound sensitivity; common in mornings.[2][4][8] | Lasts hours to days. |\n| **Tension headache** | Pressure around head, linked to sleep issues or stress.[4][6] | Improves with rest/hydration. |\n| **Cluster headache** | Severe pain around one eye, cyclical; nausea less common but possible from pain intensity.[1] | Restlessness during attacks. |\n| **Cervicogenic headache** | Neck-origin pain radiating to head, nausea fro",

      "response": "A typical investment allocation for a 35-year-old with $50,000 in savings would follow a **growth-oriented approach with moderate risk**, allocating approximately **60\u201370% to stocks, 30\u201340% to bonds, and a small allocation to cash or alternatives**.\n\n## Recommended Allocation Breakdown\n\nBased on common guidelines, here's a practical structure:\n\n**Primary allocation:**\n- **65% stocks ($32,500)** for growth potential[1]\n- **30% bonds ($15,000)** for stability[1]\n- **5% cash ($2,500)** for flexibility[1]\n\nThis moderate-growth portfolio balances your long time horizon (approximately 30 years until retirement at 65) with the need for some defensive protection as you approach midlife.\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\nIf you prefer a more conservative stance, you could use the \"**100 minus your age\" rule**[3], which suggests holding approximately **65% stocks and 35% bonds** at age 35. Conversely, if you have a higher risk tolerance and strong income, an **aggressive allocation of 85% stocks, 10% bonds, and 5% cash** is viable for maximum growth[3].\n\n## Stock Allocation Details\n\nWithin your stock portion, consider diversifying between **U.S. and international stocks**. A reasonable split would be approximately **40% U.S. stocks and 25% international stocks** within your total equity allocation[1], giving you exposure to both developed and emerging markets.\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\nFor a hands-off approach, **target-date funds** that automatically adjust your allocation as you approach retirement are an excellent option[5]. Alternatively, **low-cost index funds** provide instant diversification across hundreds of companies with minimal fees[5].\n\n## Long-Term Growth Potential",

      "response": "### Key Rights for Tenants Facing Early Lease Termination by Landlord to Sell Property\n\nIn Georgia, landlords generally **cannot terminate a fixed-term lease early** solely to sell the property unless the tenant has violated lease terms (e.g., nonpayment of rent, property damage, or illegal activities), in which case they must follow the formal eviction process.[4][6] If no violation exists, the landlord must honor the lease until its natural end date or negotiate a mutual early termination agreement, potentially offering incentives like cash or moving expense coverage.[4]\n\n### Steps to Take if Your Landlord Attempts Early Termination\n1. **Review your lease agreement immediately**: Check for any early termination clauses, notice requirements, or conditions allowing the landlord to end the lease for sale. Leases may include provisions for mutual agreement, but unilateral termination by the landlord for non-tenant-fault reasons is typically invalid.[4][5]\n2. **Demand written notice and verify legality**: Request the reason in writing. For fixed-term leases, landlords need a valid cause beyond selling; month-to-month tenancies allow 60 days' notice without cause.[4][6]\n3. **Do not vacate voluntarily without agreement**: Leaving early could expose you to penalties like rent payments until the lease ends, early termination fees (if the clause is enforceable as reasonable liquidated damages), or loss of your security deposit.[2][3][5][6] Security deposits must generally be returned within one month post-termination unless lease terms or damages justify withholding.[3]\n4. **Negotiate if possible**: Landlords can offer money or incentives for voluntary early exit, creating a new agreement superseding the original lease\u2014get everything in writing.[4]\n5. **Document everything**: Keep records of all communications, photos of the property condition, and proof of rent payments to protect against false violation claims.[7]\n\n### Potential Exceptions Allowing You (Tenant) Early Exit Without Penalty\nWhile the landlord's sal",
