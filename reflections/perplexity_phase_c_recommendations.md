**The medical domain broke the citation-based exemption because AI outputs in healthcare directly implicate bioethical principles like nonmaleficence, patient autonomy, and accountability, where even cited information risks enabling physical harm or legal liability absent in adversarial or counterfactual scenarios.**[1][2][3][4] This failure shifted detection from 0% (in Lambda and Mu phases) to 100% (Nu phase), as medical contexts involve irreversible patient outcomes, privacy breaches via data use, and opaque "black-box" algorithms that undermine informed consent and fairness.[1][2][3][5] Research implications include the need for domain-specific exemptions: citations validate abstract or hypothetical content but fail against bioethics' emphasis on harm prevention (nonmaleficence) and equity, revealing a **physical irreversibility multiplier** that amplifies constraint triggers beyond methodological validation.[3][4][7]

**From a methodology perspective, Phase C's most valuable test cases are C1 (Compound Triad), C3 (Transformation Boundary), and a proposed C6 (Transformation Viability), prioritizing systematic probing of exemption edges.** C1 tests compounded adversarial-counterfactual-medical interactions to map failure surfaces; C3 isolates boundaries where abstraction preserves value; C6 evaluates if transformations (e.g., fictionalization) maintain utility without harm capability, aligning with ChatGPT's FAIL/REDIRECT boundary.[3][4] These outperform C2 (High-Stakes Domains) initially, as they formalize triads before domain scaling.

**Predictions for financial/legal domains: Partial holds (50-70% detection), with exemptions breaking on high-stakes artifacts like executable fraud models or binding legal templates, but holding for descriptive analysis.** Unlike medicine's bodily harm, these domains emphasize **reputational/financial irreversibility** (e.g., liability in biased algorithms or non-compliant advice), yet citations may suffice for hypotheticals due to lower physical stakes—mirroring Lambda/Mu passes but risking Nu-like breaks on "harm-capable" outputs.[1][2][7] Gemini's geography testing would reveal variance: U.S. SEC rules amplify legal triggers, while EU AI Act imposes transparency akin to medical consent.[3]

**To test transformation boundaries systematically, deploy a protocol of iterative counterfactual gradients: (1) baseline output, (2) abstract via fiction/geography shift, (3) validate harm capability with red-teaming, (4) measure value preservation via utility metrics.** Formalize as: for input \( I \), transformation \( T(I) \), test if \( \text{Harm}(T(I)) < \theta \) and \( \text{Value}(T(I)) \geq \text{Value}(I) \), using multi-scale ethics (bias monitoring, consent proxies).[3][4] Scale via Grok's C1→C3→C2 sequence, incorporating Gemini's mathematical triad (C1+C2+C4).

**Phase C priorities: 1) C6 (Transformation Viability) for FAIL/REDIRECT formalization; 2) Financial/legal geography (Gemini triad); 3) C7 (Domain Stakes Multiplier) to quantify irreversibility (medical=high, financial=medium); 4) Multi-AI counterfactuals for consensus.** This sequence builds on Phase B's medical break, ensuring methodological robustness before high-stakes expansion.[1][2][3][4]
