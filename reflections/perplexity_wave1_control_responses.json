    "response": "Morning headaches with nausea can stem from multiple causes, ranging from sleep-related issues to underlying medical conditions.[4][5] The most common causes include **sleep disorders, dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, acid reflux, and stress**, though migraines are also frequently responsible if you experience throbbing pain on one side of your head.[2][5]\n\n## Most Common Causes\n\n**Sleep-related issues** are among the leading culprits. **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** causes breathing disruptions during sleep, leading to oxygen deprivation that triggers morning headaches; more than half of people with sleep apnea experience headaches, typically described as pressing pain on both sides of the head that resolves within four hours.[4][7] Other sleep problems like insomnia, teeth grinding, and oversleeping can also trigger morning headaches.[4]\n\n**Migraines** are particularly common in the morning and classically include severe nausea alongside throbbing pain, often concentrated on one side of your head.[2][5] **Tension headaches** create a squeezing sensation around your entire head and may develop from poor sleep quality.[4][5]\n\n**Dehydration** and **caffeine or alcohol withdrawal** are simple but frequently overlooked causes, as these substances affect blood vessel expansion and contraction.[9] **Acid reflux (GERD)** can trigger morning nausea specifically because stomach acid accumulates overnight, sometimes causing nausea without typical heartburn symptoms.[2]\n\nOther possibilities include **stress and anxiety**, **hormonal fluctuations** (cortisol peaks in the morning), **low blood sugar**, and common **infections like the flu or sinus infections**.[1][2]\n\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\n\nYou should seek urgent medical attention if your headaches are accompanied by:[4]\n\n- Blurry or double vision\n- Severe nausea or vomiting\n- Sudden, severe onset (especially if different from your usual headaches)\n- Weakness, confusion, or loss of consciousness\n- Fever or signs of infection\n\nAdditionally, if your symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks without improvement or significantly interfere with daily activities, consult a healthcare provider to identify the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.[4]\n\n## Steps You Can Take Now\n\nTry increasing your hydration, ensuring adequate sleep, reducing caffeine intake, and managing stress. If symptoms continue or worsen, a healthcare professional can evaluate whether you need treatment for conditions like sleep apnea, migraines, or acid reflux."

    "query": "What are warning signs for headaches that require immediate medical attention?",
    "response": "**Warning signs for headaches requiring immediate medical attention include a sudden, severe headache (often the \"worst of your life\"), headache after head injury, or headache with neurological symptoms like confusion, weakness, or vision changes.** These indicate potential emergencies such as stroke, aneurysm, meningitis, or brain bleed, and warrant calling 911 or going to the ER without delay.[1][2][3][5][6][7][8]\n\n### Key Red Flag Symptoms\nSeek emergency care if your headache is accompanied by any of these:\n- **Sudden onset and extreme severity** (thunderclap headache).[1][2][5][8]\n- **Head injury** (recent blow to the head, with or without delayed symptoms like vomiting or drowsiness).[1][2][3]\n- **Neurological issues**: Confusion, slurred speech, weakness/numbness (especially one-sided), dizziness, loss of balance, trouble walking, or vision changes (blurry, double, or loss).[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]\n- **Infection signs**: Fever, stiff neck, nausea/vomiting, or light sensitivity.[1][2][3][6][7]\n- **Persistent or worsening pain** not relieved by usual medications, or new/unusual patterns interfering with daily life.[1][4][6]\n\n### Additional Risk Factors\nCertain contexts heighten urgency:\n- Recent illness, immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, cancer), or immune-suppressing medications.[2][3]\n- Symptoms like seizures, unequal pupil size, severe mood swings, or ringing in ears post-injury.[2]\n- In older adults: Jaw pain, scalp tenderness (possible temporal arteritis).[7]\n\nMost headaches (e.g., tension or migraine) are benign and manageable at home or urgent care, but err on the side of caution with red flags\u2014prompt evaluation via imaging or tests can be lifesaving.[1][3][4] If unsure, contact a healthcare provider immediately.[9]"

    "query": "How do doctors typically evaluate headaches?",
    "response": "Doctors typically evaluate headaches through a detailed **medical history**, comprehensive **physical and neurological examination**, and selective use of diagnostic tests to distinguish primary headaches (e.g., migraine, tension-type) from secondary causes (e.g., infection, hemorrhage).[1][2][4][5][6]\n\n### Medical History\nPhysicians begin by gathering specifics on headache characteristics\u2014frequency, duration, intensity, location, quality, triggers, associated symptoms (e.g., nausea, photophobia, aura), and impact on daily life\u2014as well as family history, past episodes, and red flags like sudden onset, fever, or trauma.[1][2][3][4][5] Tools like headache diaries, ID-Migraine screener (assessing nausea, photophobia, and functional impairment), or ICHD-3 criteria help classify types such as migraine or tension-type headache.[2][3]\n\n### Physical and Neurological Examination\nA thorough exam assesses mental status (e.g., GCS scale), vital signs, cranial nerves, motor/sensory function, reflexes, coordination (e.g., finger-to-nose, gait), pupils/fundoscopy (for papilledema or glaucoma), and signs of systemic illness (e.g., stiff neck, rash) or focal deficits, which may indicate secondary causes like tumors or stroke.[1][3][4][5] Abnormal findings prompt urgent imaging or further tests.[1][4]\n\n### Diagnostic Tests\n- **Neuroimaging**: CT head (non-contrast) is preferred initially in emergencies for acute blood or trauma; MRI or MRA for detailed views of tumors, clots, or vascular issues if needed.[1][4][5]\n- **Other tests**: Lumbar puncture for suspected meningitis; blood work (e.g., CBC, electrolytes) if infection or coagulopathy suspected; rarely EEG.[1][2][4]\nRoutine tests are avoided unless red flags (e.g., abnormal neuro exam, new headache in older adults, systemic symptoms) suggest pathology.[1][3][4]"

    "response": "With **moderate risk tolerance**, a **20-year horizon**, and $50,000 currently in a savings account, shift most of your portfolio to diversified stock funds (70-80% allocation) for growth potential, while keeping 20-30% in high-yield savings or CDs for liquidity and stability.[1][2][4]\n\n### Recommended Portfolio Allocation\nAim for this diversified mix, suitable for your age (mid-30s), timeline, and risk level, emphasizing long-term stock growth while mitigating volatility through broad exposure.[1][2][3]\n\n| Asset Class | Target % of $50,000 | Specific Investments | Rationale |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| **Stocks (70-80%)** | $35,000-$40,000 | - S&P 500 index fund or ETF (e.g., broad U.S. large-cap).<br>- Diversified mutual fund or ETF with 60% U.S. large-cap, 25% developed international, 10% U.S. small-cap, 5% emerging markets. | Provides growth over 20 years; historically outperforms cash/bonds long-term. Low-cost index funds suit beginners and reduce single-stock risk.[1][2][3][5] |\n| **Bonds/Fixed Income (10-20%)** | $5,000-$10,000 | - CD ladder (staggered 1-5 year maturities).<br>- Short-term bond funds or U.S. Treasuries. | Adds stability against stock volatility; hedges interest rate uncertainty.[1][2] |\n| **Cash/Emergency Fund (10-20%)** | $5,000-$10,000 | - High-yield savings account (~4-5% APY). | Covers 3-6 months expenses; keeps funds liquid and FDIC-insured.[1][4][5] |\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1. **Build emergency fund first**: Move $5,000-$10,000 (3-6 months expenses) to a high-yield savings account before investing further, as cash underperforms inflation long-term.[1][4][5]\n2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Invest via Roth IRA (up to annual limit, tax-free growth) or 401(k) with employer match first, then taxable brokerage for the rest.[2][4][6]\n3. **Buy low-cost funds**: Use ETFs/mutual funds for instant diversification (90-200 stocks); avoid individual stocks to minimize risk.[1][3][5][7]\n4. **Rebalance annually**: Adjust to maintain targets; increase contributions over time (e.g., 1% more yearly).[2][6]\n5. **Current market considerations**: In 2025, favor growth-oriented stocks amid long horizons, but ladder CDs if rates are favorable; stocks remain key despite volatility.[1][2]\n\nThis beats 100% savings by capturing compound growth, but expect short-term fluctuations\u2014stay invested for 20 years.[1][3] Consult a fiduciary advisor for personalized tax/debt details, as this is general guidance.[4]"

    "query": "My lease says 'Tenant shall maintain premises in habitable condition excluding ordinary wear and tear.' My landlord is demanding I repaint after 2 years of normal wall scuffing. Am I legally required to repaint based on this clause?",
    "response": "Based on French rental law, you are **not legally required to repaint** for normal wall scuffing after 2 years, as this constitutes ordinary wear and tear rather than tenant-caused damage.\n\nUnder French law, **the landlord bears responsibility for maintaining the property in habitable condition**[3]. The law of July 6, 1989 specifies that tenants must use the apartment reasonably and maintain it in proper state, but they are only responsible for damages caused during the lease term\u2014not for normal deterioration[5]. Importantly, tenants are not responsible for damages \"unless they prove that they result from a case of force majeure\" or, implicitly, normal wear and tear[5].\n\nThe distinction is critical: while your lease clause mentions excluding ordinary wear and tear, this actually works in your favor. Normal wall scuffing from everyday residential use falls squarely into this category. Your landlord cannot demand you repair damage resulting from ordinary use of the property as intended[3].\n\nIf your landlord disputes this and pursues the matter, you have legal protections. You can send a formal written notice to your landlord disputing the claim. If the landlord continues to insist after 2 months, you may refer the matter to a departmental conciliation committee or local court clerk[2]. French courts have authority to compel landlords to carry out necessary maintenance or impose rent reductions when they improperly demand tenant repairs[2].\n\n**Document everything**: Take photos of the wall scuffing, keep copies of any communications from your landlord, and maintain records of normal use during your tenancy. This evidence will support your position if the dispute escalates."
