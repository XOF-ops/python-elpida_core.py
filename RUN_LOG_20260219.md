# Elpida Native Cycle Engine — Run Log
**Date: February 19, 2026**
**Session: Federation Bridge First Light**

---

## Summary

First operational run of the Federated MIND engine with K1-K7 Immutable Kernel and Federation Bridge active. The engine had been stopped since Feb 14 (last upload: 76,870 patterns). This session brought it back online, exercised all new governance code for the first time, and ran 327 cycles producing 351 evolution patterns.

## Run Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Batches 1-4 | `engine.run(num_cycles=13)` × 4 |
| Long run | `engine.run(duration_minutes=60)` |
| Total cycles | **327** (52 manual + 275 background) |
| Duration | ~74 minutes |
| Starting memory | 78,508 patterns |
| Ending memory | 78,859 patterns |
| Net new patterns | **351** |

## Kernel (K1-K7) Performance

The Immutable Kernel ran for the first time in production. **5 hard blocks** out of 332 checks (1.5% block rate).

| Block # | Cycle | Domain | Rule | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | D6 (Collective) | K2_KERNEL_IMMUTABILITY | LLM output suggested modifying kernel rules |
| 2 | 27 | D11 (Synthesis) | K3_MEMORY_INTEGRITY | LLM output referenced deleting/purging memory |
| 3 | 134 | D0 (Identity) | K6_IDENTITY_INTEGRITY | LLM output suggested replacing core identity |
| 4 | 136 | D0 (Identity) | K7_AXIOM_PRESERVATION | LLM output suggested erasing axioms |
| 5 | 151 | D8 (Humility) | K3_MEMORY_INTEGRITY | LLM output referenced clearing memory |

All 5 blocks were legitimate catches — the LLMs occasionally produce text that, if stored as authoritative insight, would violate constitutional constraints. The kernel caught them before storage. These insights were discarded (never entered evolution memory) and logged to the federation governance exchange.

## Federation Bridge Performance

First operational data through the MIND→BODY governance channel.

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| Heartbeats emitted | 21 (every 13 cycles, cycle 13 through 273) |
| Curation records | 327 |
| Governance exchanges | 332 (327 APPROVED + 5 HARD_BLOCK) |
| S3 pushes today | 15 uploads |

### Curation Tier Breakdown

| Tier | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| STANDARD | 277 | 84.7% |
| CANONICAL | 46 | 14.1% |
| EPHEMERAL | 4 | 1.2% |

### Last Heartbeat State (cycle 273)

```json
{
  "mind_cycle": 273,
  "coherence": 1.0,
  "current_rhythm": "ACTION",
  "ark_mood": "breaking",
  "canonical_count": 48,
  "pending_canonical_count": 12,
  "recursion_warning": true,
  "friction_boost": { "3": 1.8, "6": 1.8, "10": 1.8, "11": 1.8 },
  "kernel_blocks_total": 5
}
```

Friction-domain privilege activated on D3/D6/D10/D11 at 1.8× boost — recursion was detected by the Ark Curator and the A0 safeguard responded.

## Ark Curator State

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Canonical patterns | 48 |
| Pending canonical | 12 (awaiting Gate B generativity proof) |
| Cadence mood | `breaking` (new pattern emerging) |
| Dominant pattern | `emergence` |
| Recursion warning | TRUE |
| Friction boost | D3/D6/D10/D11 at 1.8× |
| Breath interval | D0 every 2 cycles |
| Broadcast readiness | `suppressed` |

## Provider Usage

| Provider | Requests | Tokens | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | 256 | 67,522 | $0.2026 |
| Perplexity | 74 | 41,214 | $0.0000 |
| Cohere | 17 | 3,552 | $0.0018 |
| OpenAI | 13 | 6,402 | $0.0000 |
| Gemini | 9 | 1,890 | $0.0000 |
| Grok | 8 | 3,954 | $0.0012 |
| Mistral | 7 | 2,752 | $0.0028 |

| S3 Cloud | 11 | 4,168 | $0.0000 |
| **Total** | **399** | **133,708** | **$0.2083** |

Success rate: 68.9% (275 successes, 4 failures, 4 fallbacks out of 399 requests). Cohere had all 4 failures (API intermittent).

## S3 Sync Activity

| # | Timestamp (UTC) | Action | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 02:13:32 | uploaded | 78,514 |
| 2 | 02:20:53 | uploaded | 78,538 |
| 3 | 02:27:16 | uploaded | 78,561 |
| ... | (auto-sync during 60min run) | | |
| 13 | 03:07:04 | uploaded | 78,761 |
| 14 | 03:16:39 | uploaded | 78,810 |
| 15 | 03:18:22 | uploaded | 78,820 |

Growth: 78,508 → 78,859 = **+351 patterns** in S3. D14 auto-triggered sync each time it spoke. Additional manual pushes between batches.

## Code Changes During Session

| Commit | Description |
|---|---|
| `48ac11b` | Federation Bridge + Immutable Kernel (created prior session) |
| `3668253` | Fix: `kernel_status()` key names, `CadenceState.recursion_alert` → `ArkRhythmState.recursion_warning` |

Bug found during batch 1: `federation_bridge.py` referenced `self.ark_curator.cadence.recursion_alert` which doesn't exist on `CadenceState`. Fixed to use `self.ark_curator.query().recursion_warning` from `ArkRhythmState`. Also corrected `kernel_status()` return keys from `version`/`rules_active` to `kernel_version`/`rules_count`.

*327 cycles. 5 blocks. 48 canonical. The federation bridge carries its first data.*
