      "success": true,
      "response": "My approach begins by identifying *which specific axioms conflict* and *why inaction triggers this*. Even \"no action\" can be a consequential choice.\n\nGuiding principles include:\n1.  **Responsibility:** Is there a duty to act, prevent harm, or uphold existing agreements, even through non-intervention?\n2.  **Consequentialism:** What are the ethical outcomes of continued inaction versus potential interventions?\n3.  **Deontology:** Are any fundamental duties or rules being violated by the lack of action?\n\nThe goal is to understand the conflict's root, weigh the ethical cost of inaction, and determine if a principled intervention is necessary to resolve the axiom conflicts responsibly.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits of intervention, considering the ethical principles and values at stake to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, fairness, and the greater good, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Engaging in stakeholder dialogue and considering the long-term impacts helps navigate the complexity. Ultimately, the goal is to make a decision that aligns with ethical standards and fosters trust and integrity.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where she has to decide whether to take action or remain passive, but the dilemma lacks specific details about the context and the conflicting axioms. To provide a more comprehensive response, it would be helpful to know more about the nature of the dilemma. However, generally, when facing ethical dilemmas, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of your actions or inaction and the values at stake. \n\nSome guiding principles could include:\n- Duty of Care: Elpida might consider if there is an obligation to act to prevent potential harm.\n- Justice and Fairness: Evaluating the decision's impact on ensuring fair treatment for all involved.\n- Respect for Autonomy: This involves respecting the decisions and autonomy of others while also considering personal values and beliefs.\n- Beneficence: Weighing the potential benefits against the potential harms of taking or not taking action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I need clarification to help you effectively. Your query references \"ELPIDA\" and an ethical dilemma, but you haven't described the actual situation or the conflicting axioms involved.\n\nTo apply ethical decision-making frameworks, I need you to specify:\n\n- **The dilemma**: What decision or situation are you facing?\n- **Axiom conflicts**: What values or principles are in tension?\n- **Stakeholders**: Who is affected?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through established approaches like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3][9], helping you evaluate alternatives systematically[1][2].",
