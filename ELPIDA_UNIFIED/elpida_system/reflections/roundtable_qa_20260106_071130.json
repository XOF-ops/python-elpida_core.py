      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since \"Action: None\" and \"Axiom Conflicts\" are given, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and the conflicting principles. I'd guide my decision by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individual rights), weighing the potential outcomes and choosing the least harmful option.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, I focus on the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices). Without a clear action, the goal is to analyze the situation, identify conflicting values, and seek a resolution that aligns with these principles. If further context or actions emerge, the decision can be guided by these foundational ethical considerations.",

Guiding principles: **autonomy, justice, common good, and utilitarianism**\u2014prioritizing fairness and minimal harm [2][3].
