    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness and equity), I would seek to understand the specific ethical tensions involved. This involves gathering all relevant information, considering the perspectives of all stakeholders, and exploring potential consequences of different actions to find a balanced and ethically sound resolution.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. When considering ethical dilemmas, it's crucial to prioritize transparency and ethical conduct. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the importance of avoiding actions that cause harm. By not taking action, Elpida might aim to prevent any potential negative consequences. However, this should be balanced with the principle of beneficence, which encourages actions that promote the well-being of others. Elpida might consider whether inaction could potentially lead to missed opportunities to help or resolve an issue. \n\nA comprehensive understanding of the situation and careful consideration of potential outcomes are essential to making an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate alternatives using principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**, assess consequences, and select the most ethical option with transparent implementation and review.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, drawn from frameworks like utilitarianism and deontology.[3][4] This ensures balanced, defensible decisions.
