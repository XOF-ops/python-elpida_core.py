      "response": "The core of this dilemma is that \"Action: None\" itself generates axiom conflicts. My first step would be to **identify and deeply understand** these specific conflicting axioms.\n\nGuiding principles include:\n1.  **Consequentialism:** Analyze the potential harm or benefit of inaction versus various interventions.\n2.  **Deontology:** Prioritize duties and obligations violated by inaction.\n3.  **Principlism:** Seek to uphold principles like non-maleficence and beneficence.\n\nI would then actively search for alternative actions that resolve the conflicts or best balance competing ethical duties, recognizing that inaction, when problematic, demands an active search for a better path.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential benefits and harms of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that align with these principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the first step is to clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices), I would seek to understand the context and stakeholders affected. The goal is to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and values. If more details are provided, a more specific solution can be offered.",
