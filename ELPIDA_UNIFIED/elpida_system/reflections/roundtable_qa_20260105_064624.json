      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is taken, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision-making process. It's important to weigh these principles, consider the potential outcomes, and seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good. Engaging stakeholders in dialogue can also provide valuable perspectives.",
