    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential benefits and harms of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that align with these principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms from Elpida, the first step is to clarify the core issue and the conflicting values. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while respecting all stakeholders' rights and interests. Transparency and communication are crucial in finding a resolution that aligns with ethical standards.",

      "response": "I'd need more details about the specific ethical dilemma from Elpida to provide targeted guidance. However, here's a general approach based on established frameworks[1][2][3]:\n\n1. **Identify the issue** \u2013 Clarify what values or principles conflict[9]\n2. **Gather facts** \u2013 Collect unbiased information and understand stakeholder perspectives[1][2]\n3. **Apply ethical principles** \u2013 Consider autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n4. **Evaluate consequences** \u2013 Weigh short and long-term impacts[2][3]\n5. **Consult others** \u2013 Discuss with relevant parties to gain diverse insights[6]\n6. **Implement transparently** \u2013 Choose the option best balancing ethics with practicality[3]\n\nCould you share the specific dilemma details?",
