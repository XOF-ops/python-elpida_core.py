      "success": true,
      "response": "The dilemma indicates inaction (None) is problematic, directly leading to the violation of core principles (Axioms). My approach would be:\n\n1.  **Identify Specific Conflicts:** Clearly define *which* axioms are conflicting and *why* inaction causes this.\n2.  **Duty to Act:** Recognize that failing to act is an ethical choice with negative consequences.\n3.  **Proactive Resolution:** Prioritize actions that uphold the violated axioms, mitigate harm, and restore ethical integrity.\n\nPrinciples guiding this: **Responsibility** (to address conflicts), **Deontology** (upholding duties implied by axioms), and **Consequentialism** (avoiding negative outcomes from inaction).",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. When faced with such dilemmas, it's crucial to consider the principles of responsibility and the potential consequences of inaction. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the duty of care, which implies that Elpida has a responsibility to act in a way that prevents harm or negative outcomes. Inaction might be justifiable if it can be shown that any action would likely result in more harm than good. However, this should be supported by a thorough analysis of the situation and a clear understanding of the potential consequences. Transparency and ethical decision-making processes are key to navigating such complex situations.",

      "response": "I'd need more details about Elpida's specific dilemma to apply ethical frameworks effectively. However, here's a general approach:\n\n**Key steps:**[1][2]\n1. **Identify the ethical issue** \u2013 clarify what values conflict\n2. **Gather facts** \u2013 understand the situation objectively\n3. **Consider stakeholders** \u2013 whose interests are affected?\n4. **Apply ethical principles** \u2013 use autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n5. **Evaluate consequences** \u2013 weigh short and long-term impacts\n6. **Choose and communicate** \u2013 select the most ethical option transparently[3]\n\nCould you share Elpida's specific situation so I can provide targeted guidance?",
