      "response": "Approaching \"Action: None\" when fundamental values are in conflict requires treating inaction as a deliberate ethical choice. First, clearly define the specific axioms being violated and the harms caused by *not acting*.\n\nNext, identify alternative actions that better align with prioritized values, especially those minimizing harm or fulfilling core duties.\n\nGuiding principles include consequentialism (evaluating potential outcomes), deontology (identifying duties to act), and the imperative to resolve conflicts that undermine one's moral framework.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing ethical demands.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms. Generally, I would start by identifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would assess the potential impacts of different actions on all stakeholders. My guiding principle is to seek the most balanced and least harmful outcome while respecting all involved parties. If you can provide more details, I can offer a more tailored response.",
