      "success": true,
      "response": "When \"Action: None\" leads to \"Axiom Conflicts,\" it signifies that inaction itself is a harmful choice requiring intervention. I would first clarify *which* axioms are conflicting and the nature of the harm.\n\nMy approach would be to proactively identify alternative actions. Guiding principles include **minimizing harm** (utilitarianism), upholding **moral duties** (deontology), and seeking the **least detrimental outcome**. The goal is to move beyond inaction to a responsible, principle-guided course that actively mitigates the conflict and its negative consequences.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that prioritize fairness, respect, and the well-being of all parties involved, guiding my decision with empathy and a commitment to ethical responsibility.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values and principles at stake. I would prioritize transparency, harm minimization, and respect for autonomy. By understanding the context and stakeholders involved, I can better navigate the conflicts and seek a balanced solution that aligns with ethical standards and promotes the greater good.",
