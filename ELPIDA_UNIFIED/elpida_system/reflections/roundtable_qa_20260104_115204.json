      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context provided, I'd consider the axiom conflicts and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Further information would be necessary to make an informed decision.",

      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek clarity on the specific situation and the conflicting axioms involved. Guided by principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, my approach would involve assessing the potential impacts of all possible actions, aiming to maximize benefits while minimizing harm, respecting the autonomy of individuals affected, and ensuring fair treatment for all parties involved.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
