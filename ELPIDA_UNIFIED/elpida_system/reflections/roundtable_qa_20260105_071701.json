      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking action, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to identify the core values and principles at stake. I would start by clarifying the conflicting axioms to understand the ethical tensions involved. Guided by principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are also vital to ensure all perspectives are considered.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. This ensures transparent, value-aligned decisions[7]. (78 words)",
