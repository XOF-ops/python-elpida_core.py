      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of context, I would approach this dilemma by seeking more information about the situation and the axiom conflicts. I would be guided by principles of fairness, respect, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I would consider the potential consequences of different actions and weigh the moral and ethical implications to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

My approach involves identifying the stakeholders, understanding their perspectives, and assessing the potential impacts of different actions. Guided by principles of fairness, respect for autonomy, and harm minimization, I would seek a balanced solution that mitigates conflicts and promotes the greater good. If more specific details were provided, a more tailored response could be offered.",
