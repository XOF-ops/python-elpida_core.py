      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking a different course of action, considering the ethical implications and potential outcomes.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the first step is to clarify the underlying axioms or values in conflict. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the analysis. Identifying and weighing these principles helps in understanding the core of the conflict and formulating a balanced perspective. If more context is provided, a more tailored response can be given.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term good over short-term gains[4]. (78 words)",
