    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the ethical implications of inaction. Principles guiding my decision would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles against potential consequences of inaction to determine the most ethical course.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is indicated, it's crucial to clarify the context and identify the conflicting axioms or principles. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the core issues and stakeholders involved. The goal is to resolve conflicts through dialogue and transparency, aiming for a solution that minimizes harm and respects all parties' rights and values.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially lead to a conflict with her personal values or ethical principles. Without more context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive solution, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n- **Identify the Axioms:** Elpida should first clarify her own moral principles and values. Understanding the axioms that are in conflict is essential to resolving the dilemma. For example, is it a matter of honesty vs. compassion, or personal freedom vs. responsibility?\n\n- **Consider Consequences:** Evaluate the potential outcomes of each action. Sometimes, ethical decisions require weighing the benefits and harms to determine the least detrimental course of action. \n\n- **Seek Alternative Solutions:** Explore different options. Is there a way to address the situation that aligns with all her axioms? Creativity and critical thinking can help find unique solutions that might not be immediately apparent. \n\n- **Consult and Discuss:** Engaging in dialogue with trusted individuals can offer new perspectives and help refine one's ethical reasoning.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, and evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology).[1][2][3] Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** while fostering open discussion. Select, implement, and review the most ethical option transparently.[7][9] (78 words)",
