      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greatest good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or values involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting the rights and dignity of all parties.",
