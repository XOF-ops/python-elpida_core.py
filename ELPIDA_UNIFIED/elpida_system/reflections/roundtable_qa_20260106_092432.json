      "response": "This dilemma reveals inaction as an ethical choice with consequences.\n\n**Approach:**\n1.  **Identify Specific Axioms:** Clearly define *which* axioms are conflicting and *why* \"Action: None\" violates them. What fundamental values (e.g., justice, safety, duty) are at stake?\n2.  **Evaluate Harm:** Assess the potential harm or negative outcomes resulting from inaction.\n\n**Guiding Principles:**\n*   **Responsibility:** Acknowledge the duty to act when core values are threatened.\n*   **Harm Reduction:** Prioritize actions that prevent or minimize negative impacts.\n*   **Prioritization:** If multiple axioms conflict, determine which holds greater moral weight in the specific context.\n\nSeek an alternative action that better aligns with the most critical axioms.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking action, considering the moral and ethical implications of each option.",

      "response": "In the absence of a specific action and clear axiom conflicts, the approach would focus on gathering more information to understand the context and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles include transparency, harm minimization, and stakeholder well-being. The goal is to make an informed decision that aligns with ethical standards and promotes the greater good.",
