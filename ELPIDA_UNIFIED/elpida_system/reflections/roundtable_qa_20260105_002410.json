      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action taken, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. I'd be guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), weighing the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking action to resolve the dilemma.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or values at play. I would start by clarifying the core ethical principles involved, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders affected. My decision would aim to balance these principles, seeking the least harmful and most equitable outcome. If you can provide more details about the specific dilemma, I can offer a more tailored response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida seems to be faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between different ethical principles or values. Without more context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive solution, but here are some guiding principles:\n\n1. **Clarify the Axioms**: Understanding the specific axioms or values at odds is crucial. Are they related to honesty, fairness, respect for autonomy, or preventing harm? Identifying the conflicting principles can help structure the decision-making process.\n\n2. **Gather Information**: Elpida should gather all relevant facts and consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, taking no action can have significant implications. Understanding the full scope of the situation is essential for ethical decision-making.\n\n3. **Seek Alternatives**: Explore options that could resolve the dilemma. Is there a way to address the issue while respecting all relevant ethical considerations? Creative problem-solving might reveal a solution that aligns with Elpida's values.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [2][6]. (78 words)",
