      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that prioritize fairness, respect, and the well-being of all parties involved. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual freedom), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek to understand all perspectives and potential impacts. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all involved parties.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially lead to a conflict with her personal values or ethical principles. While the details are not provided, it seems that Elpida's dilemma revolves around the decision to act or remain passive. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, taking no action can have just as significant an impact as taking the wrong action. Elpida should examine the underlying principles at stake and determine which values are most important to uphold. Prioritizing values like honesty, integrity, and responsibility can guide her decision-making process, ensuring that her actions (or inaction) align with her moral compass and cause the least harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate options using principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, and assess consequences via frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology).[1][2][3] Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and well-being** while fostering transparent discussion. Select, implement, and review the most ethical solution.[7][9] (68 words)",
