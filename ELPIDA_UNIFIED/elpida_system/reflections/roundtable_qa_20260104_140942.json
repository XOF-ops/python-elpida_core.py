Principles guiding my decision include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and balance competing values to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

The guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness). I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders, assess the potential consequences of different actions, and aim for a resolution that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm, ensuring fairness and respect for all parties.",

Guiding principles prioritize integrity, transparency, and long-term accountability over short-term gains[6][8]. Implement, monitor, and consult others for balanced decisions[1][7]. (78 words)",
