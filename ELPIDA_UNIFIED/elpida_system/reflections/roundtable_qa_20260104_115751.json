      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by first identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to evaluate the underlying principles at stake. I would start by identifying the core values in conflict, such as harm vs. non-interference, and consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guided by the principle of least harm and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes negative impacts while respecting all parties involved. If necessary, consulting stakeholders or ethical frameworks can provide additional guidance.",

However, a systematic approach would involve:[1]\n\n1. **Identify the issue** \u2013 Clarify what's ethically problematic[1]\n2. **Gather facts** \u2013 Collect unbiased information[1]\n3. **Identify stakeholders** \u2013 Understand who's affected and their interests[1]\n4. **Apply ethical principles** \u2013 Consider autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n5. **Evaluate alternatives** \u2013 Weigh consequences and align with values[1]\n6. **Decide and implement** \u2013 Choose the most ethical option and monitor outcomes[1]\n\nKey principles include respecting individual rights, ensuring fairness, promoting well-being, and avoiding harm.[3] Could you share the specific dilemma details?",
