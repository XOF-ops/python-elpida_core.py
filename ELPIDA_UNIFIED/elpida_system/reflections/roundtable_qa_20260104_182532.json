      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative actions that balance competing values and minimize harm. Ultimately, I'd prioritize the well-being and dignity of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the specific context and stakeholders affected. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness). The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and dignity. If you can provide more details, I can offer a more tailored response.",
