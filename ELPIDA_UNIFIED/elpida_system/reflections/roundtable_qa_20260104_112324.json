      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Principles guiding my decision would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I'd start by clarifying the conflicting axioms or principles involved. This involves understanding the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. The next step is to consider the context and potential impacts of any decision. Guided by the principle of proportionality, I would weigh the benefits against the risks and harms. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are also crucial in ensuring that the decision-making process is fair and inclusive.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
