      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the specific issue and identify the stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand the context fully. This involves gathering all relevant information and considering the potential impacts of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, aligning with ethical standards and values.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and integrity while fostering open dialogue [1][6]. (78 words)",
