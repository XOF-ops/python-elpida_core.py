      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of intervening, considering the moral and ethical implications of each option.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is proposed, it's crucial to consider core ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy. Without a clear action or context from Elpida, the focus should be on understanding the underlying issues and stakeholders involved. Engaging in thoughtful deliberation and seeking input from diverse perspectives can help navigate the complexity and arrive at a principled decision.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
