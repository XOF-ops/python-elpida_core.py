      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since the action is \"none,\" I'd weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of intervening, if any, to determine the most ethical course. Further information is needed to make a decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by identifying and understanding these core values, such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. My approach would be guided by the principle of seeking the greatest good while minimizing harm, ensuring that all stakeholders' perspectives are considered. If the dilemma involves potential harm, I would prioritize actions that prevent or mitigate it. Transparency and communication are also vital in resolving ethical conflicts.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer a general approach to navigate such a dilemma. \n\nWhen faced with a decision, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences and the underlying values at stake. Elpida should examine the possible outcomes of inaction and determine if it aligns with her moral and ethical beliefs. She should ask herself if inaction could potentially cause harm or violate the rights of others. \n\nKey principles that could guide her decision-making include the duty of care, where one must consider the well-being of those affected, and the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes avoiding actions that cause harm. Balancing these principles can help Elpida make an informed choice.",
