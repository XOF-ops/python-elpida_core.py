      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida with no action specified and axiom conflicts, I would first clarify the specific axioms in conflict and the context of the dilemma. My approach is guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness). I would seek to understand all perspectives, evaluate potential outcomes, and strive for a resolution that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and well-being for all involved, drawing from utilitarianism and deontology[3][4]. This ensures transparent, value-aligned decisions[7].
