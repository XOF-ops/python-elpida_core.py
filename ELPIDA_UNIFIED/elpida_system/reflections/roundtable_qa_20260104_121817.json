      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the implications of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), autonomy, and fairness. I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits of taking a proactive approach, considering the ethical axiom conflicts to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is indicated and there are axiom conflicts, the guiding principles are transparency, fairness, and the promotion of the greater good. I would start by clearly identifying the conflicting axioms and their implications. Then, engage stakeholders in a dialogue to understand different perspectives. Finally, seek a compromise that minimizes harm and aligns with ethical standards, ensuring that the decision respects all parties involved as much as possible.",
