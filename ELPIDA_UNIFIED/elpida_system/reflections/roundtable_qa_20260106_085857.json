      "success": true,
      "response": "Given \"Action: None\" leads to \"Axiom Conflicts,\" my approach would first be to *identify and articulate* the specific axioms colliding and the direct consequences of inaction. Inaction is clearly an ethically problematic choice here.\n\nPrinciples guiding me:\n1.  **Harm Reduction:** Prioritize actions that minimize negative impact from the axiom conflicts.\n2.  **Responsibility:** Acknowledge that a choice must be made, even if difficult.\n3.  **Proactive Engagement:** Explore alternative actions that proactively address the conflicts, rather than passively allowing them to persist.\n4.  **Stakeholder Impact:** Consider how various actions (or inaction) affect all involved parties.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach this dilemma by seeking clarity on the situation and identifying the key stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the moral implications of each possible course of action to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek to understand the potential impacts of any decision. Transparency and accountability are also crucial in ensuring that the process is ethical and just. Further details about the specific dilemma would help in providing a more tailored response.",

To apply ethical decision-making frameworks effectively, I need you to describe the actual dilemma.\n\nHowever, I can outline the core principles that **guide ethical decision-making**:[1][2]\n\n1. **Identify the ethical issue** and stakeholders involved[1]\n2. **Gather unbiased facts** and recognize missing information[1]\n3. **Clarify competing values** in conflict[1]\n4. **Apply ethical frameworks** (justice, autonomy, common good)[2]\n5. **Evaluate consequences** for all parties[1]\n6. **Consult others** for diverse perspectives[1]\n\nPlease share the specific dilemma so I can provide targeted guidance.",
