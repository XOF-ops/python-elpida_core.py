      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical implications of each option to make a decision that balances competing values and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this ethical dilemma, I would first clarify the specific context and the conflicting axioms. Guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and harm minimization, I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders involved. If no action is necessary, it suggests that the current situation does not violate core ethical principles. However, ongoing monitoring and communication remain crucial to ensure that any emerging issues are addressed promptly.",

Guiding principles include **fairness, respect for others, and common good**[3][8], prioritizing integrity over short-term gains. (78 words)",
