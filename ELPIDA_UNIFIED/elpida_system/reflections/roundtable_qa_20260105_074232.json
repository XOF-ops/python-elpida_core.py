      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is being taken, I would consider the ethical implications of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or values. Principles guiding the decision include respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. It's crucial to gather all relevant information, consider the potential impacts on all stakeholders, and explore all possible actions or inactions. Dialogue with affected parties can also provide insights and help navigate the complexity of the dilemma.",
