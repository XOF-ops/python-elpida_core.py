      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles against potential outcomes, considering the moral implications of inaction and potential alternatives.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits, while respecting all parties involved.Dialogue and transparency in decision-making are crucial to navigate such complexities ethically.",
