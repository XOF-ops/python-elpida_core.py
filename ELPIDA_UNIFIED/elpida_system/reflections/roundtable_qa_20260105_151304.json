      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders, their interests, and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since the action is \"none,\" I'd consider whether inaction could lead to harm or neglect, and weigh the moral implications of intervening or not.",

The guiding principles include respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders affected, and potential outcomes of different actions. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting the rights and dignity of all parties involved.",
