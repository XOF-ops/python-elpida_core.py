      "success": true,
      "response": "In the absence of information, I'd gather context and clarify the situation. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against possible outcomes of intervention, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those involved. Further information is needed to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the specific ethical issues at stake, such as harm, justice, autonomy, or beneficence. My approach would be guided by the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) and the pursuit of the greatest good for the greatest number, while respecting individual rights and dignity. Understanding the context and stakeholders' perspectives is also essential to make an informed and ethical decision.",

      "response": "I notice your query references \"ELPIDA\" and specific axiom conflicts, but you haven't provided the actual dilemma details. To give you practical guidance, I need to know:\n\n- What is the specific ethical situation or decision you're facing?\n- What are the conflicting principles or values involved?\n\nOnce you share those details, I can apply a structured **ethical decision-making framework** to help you navigate it. Most approaches involve: identifying the issue, gathering facts, considering stakeholders, applying ethical principles (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence), evaluating consequences, and choosing the most ethical option.[1][2][3]\n\nPlease provide the dilemma details for tailored analysis.",
