      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being and autonomy of those involved, while respecting their rights and dignity.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered. If the conflict remains unresolved, deferring to established ethical guidelines or seeking external ethical review can provide additional insights.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict with their axioms or core principles. While the specific details are not provided, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a dilemma:\n\n- **Clarify the Axioms:** Elpida should carefully examine and define the axioms or ethical principles that are in tension. Understanding the underlying values is crucial to making an informed decision.\n\n- **Seek Additional Information:** Gathering more facts and perspectives can help identify potential consequences and alternatives. Elpida might consider consulting experts or stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding.\n\n- **Prioritize Values:** When faced with a conflict, prioritizing values can provide a framework for decision-making. Elpida should consider which principles are non-negotiable and essential to uphold in this context. \n\n- **Explore Alternatives:** It is beneficial to explore a range of possible actions to find a solution that aligns with the most important axioms while minimizing harm.",
