Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative actions that balance competing values and minimize harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the key is to identify and balance conflicting axioms or principles. I would start by clarifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. The goal is to find a resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all involved parties. If the dilemma involves a choice between equally important principles, transparency and stakeholder consultation can help navigate the decision-making process.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over expediency [4][8]. (78 words)",
