      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action is the primary concern, suggesting a potential ethical dilemma of omission or inaction. The principle of 'duty of care' could be applied here, which implies that individuals or organizations have a moral and often legal obligation to ensure the well-being of others, especially those who are vulnerable. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Could harm or negative outcomes be prevented by taking action? If so, then acting in a timely and appropriate manner is crucial. This might involve intervening, reporting the situation, or seeking advice to ensure the best possible outcome, especially if there are vulnerable individuals involved. Prioritizing the well-being and safety of others is a fundamental ethical consideration.",

Guiding principles: **autonomy, justice, common good, and non-maleficence** for fair, integrity-aligned decisions [2][3]. (78 words)",
