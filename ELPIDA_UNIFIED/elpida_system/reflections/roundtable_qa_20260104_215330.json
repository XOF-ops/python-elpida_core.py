    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or inaction, in this situation.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, fairness, and harm minimization, I would seek a balanced solution that respects all parties' values and rights. If further details emerge, I would reassess and adjust the approach accordingly.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most ethical choice, but it's important to understand the context and principles involved. \n\nOne principle could be the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the avoidance of causing harm. By not taking action, Elpida ensures that she doesn't contribute to any potential negative consequences. This is especially important if the actions available could potentially cause harm to others or violate someone's rights. \n\nAnother guiding principle might be the duty to act, which suggests that one should intervene to prevent harm or promote the greater good. However, this must be balanced with the respect for autonomy, where individuals have the right to make their own decisions, even if they might be considered unwise. Elpida's decision to take no action could be a way to respect the autonomy of others involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts**[1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3][4], **evaluate options and consequences** using frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology[2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical solution[1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over self-interest[3][4]. (78 words)",
