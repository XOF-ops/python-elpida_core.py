      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or inaction, in this situation.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy (individual choice) can guide the decision. I would seek to understand the context, identify stakeholders, and evaluate potential outcomes to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

You've referenced \"ELPIDA\" and mentioned \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but haven't described the actual ethical dilemma or situation requiring analysis.\n\nTo help you approach this effectively, I can outline the **key principles that guide ethical decision-making**[1][2][3]:\n\n1. **Identify the ethical issue** clearly\n2. **Gather relevant facts** and stakeholder perspectives\n3. **Apply ethical frameworks** (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)\n4. **Evaluate consequences** and alternative actions\n5. **Consult others** and implement transparently\n\nPlease share the specific dilemma details, and I'll apply these principles to your situation.",
