      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this by identifying the axiom conflicts and weighing their importance. Principles guiding my decision include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, I would start by clarifying the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand the underlying values and potential consequences. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties. If more context is provided, a more tailored approach can be developed.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision. The absence of action can sometimes be as influential as taking action, and this dilemma highlights the importance of considering the consequences of inaction. \n\nElpida's decision should be guided by the principles of responsibility and duty of care. Even though the axiom conflicts are not specified, the decision to do nothing can have significant implications. In some cases, inaction could lead to harm or further complications. Therefore, Elpida should carefully evaluate the potential consequences and consider if there is an ethical obligation to act or intervene, especially if someone's well-being or rights are at stake. The principle of beneficence, which encourages actions that promote the welfare of others, might also be relevant here.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[4][6]. (78 words)",
