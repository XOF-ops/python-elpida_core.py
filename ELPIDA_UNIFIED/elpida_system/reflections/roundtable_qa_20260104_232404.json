      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the missing information and key stakeholders involved. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good), to determine the most ethical course of action in the absence of explicit details.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the potential impacts and moral implications. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit.",
