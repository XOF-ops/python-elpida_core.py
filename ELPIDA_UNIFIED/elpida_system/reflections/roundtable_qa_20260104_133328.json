      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the axiom conflicts and considering the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I prioritize caution and gather more information to determine the most ethical course of action, weighing the potential benefits and harms of intervention versus non-intervention.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of different actions. My decision would be guided by the principle of minimizing harm while maximizing benefit, ensuring that the chosen path respects all stakeholders' rights and dignity. If more specific details were provided, a more tailored response could be given.",
