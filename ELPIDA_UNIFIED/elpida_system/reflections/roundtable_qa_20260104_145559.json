      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it's to take no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the context and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Open dialogue and stakeholder input can also provide valuable perspectives.",
