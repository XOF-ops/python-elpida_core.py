      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking a stance, guided by ethical principles such as respect for autonomy and justice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the specific issue and identify the conflicting values or principles involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand all perspectives and potential impacts. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all stakeholders' rights and promoting fairness.",
