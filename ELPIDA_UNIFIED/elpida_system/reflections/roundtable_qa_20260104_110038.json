      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would prioritize minimizing harm and promoting the well-being of those involved, while considering the potential consequences of inaction. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the core values at stake, such as fairness, autonomy, harm prevention, and transparency. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of different actions. My decision would be guided by the principle of minimizing harm while maximizing benefit, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated with respect and dignity. If further clarification is needed, I would seek additional information to make a more informed decision.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
