Understanding *why* no action was taken is crucial.\n\nPrinciples guiding my decision would include:\n*   **Utilitarianism:** Evaluating if inaction leads to the greatest good or harm.\n*   **Deontology:** Assessing if inaction violates fundamental duties or moral rules.\n*   **Non-maleficence:** Ensuring inaction doesn't permit preventable harm.\n*   **Transparency:** Justifying the decision and its implications.",

      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Principles guiding my decision include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the key is to analyze the underlying axioms or principles in conflict. I would start by identifying and clarifying these principles, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders involved, weighing the potential impacts of different perspectives. The goal is to find a balanced approach that respects all principles while minimizing harm and promoting the greater good.",
