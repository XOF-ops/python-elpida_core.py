    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or values. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the potential impacts of any decision. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance:\n\n- **Identify the Axioms**: Understanding the nature of the conflicting axioms is crucial. Are they related to personal values, ethical standards, or legal obligations? Clarifying these principles will help structure the decision-making process.\n\n- **Consider the Consequences**: Evaluate the potential outcomes of inaction. Sometimes, taking no action can have significant implications. Consider if this decision might cause harm, perpetuate an injustice, or violate any ethical or moral standards. \n\n- **Seek Additional Information**: If possible, gathering more facts and perspectives might help make an informed decision. Elpida should consider consulting relevant experts or stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the dilemma.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, and evaluate consequences using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology.[1][2][3] Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity, prioritizing long-term well-being over short-term gains. Seek consultation, implement transparently, and review outcomes.[1][8] (78 words)",
