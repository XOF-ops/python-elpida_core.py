      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders, their interests, and the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential benefits and harms of taking no action, considering the moral implications and potential long-term effects on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this ethical dilemma, I would first clarify the specific axiom conflicts involved. Principles guiding the decision would include transparency, accountability, and the well-being of all stakeholders. It's crucial to consider the potential impacts of inaction and explore whether there are alternative actions that could mitigate conflicts while adhering to ethical standards. Engaging in dialogue with affected parties can also provide valuable insights and foster a more informed and ethical resolution.",
