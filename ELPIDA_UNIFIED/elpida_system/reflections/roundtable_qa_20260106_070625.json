      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. I would seek to understand the context, identify all stakeholders, and consider the potential consequences of inaction. Balancing these principles, I would aim for a resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting autonomy and ensuring fairness.",

Guiding principles include **fairness**, **integrity**, and **maximizing good** for all involved[3][8]. (78 words)",
