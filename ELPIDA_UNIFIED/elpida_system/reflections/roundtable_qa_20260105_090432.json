      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd identify the conflicting principles and weigh their importance. I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and the ethical implications of each axiom. Guided by principles of fairness, respect, and non-maleficence (do no harm), I'd strive to find a balance that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved. Further information would be necessary to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the specific situation and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would aim to identify the core ethical issues and consider potential actions that could resolve the conflict while upholding these values. If more context is provided, a more tailored response can be given.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions [7]. (78 words)",
