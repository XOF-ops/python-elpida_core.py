      "response": "My approach would analyze \"Action: None\" as a deliberate choice with ethical implications, not a lack of decision. I'd identify the potential harms or benefits resulting from this inaction and any neglected or fulfilled responsibilities. The 'dilemma' itself suggests underlying axiom conflicts, even if unspecified.\n\nPrinciples guiding this evaluation include:\n*   **Non-maleficence:** Does inaction allow preventable harm?\n*   **Beneficence:** Does it forgo opportunities to do good?\n*   **Responsibility/Duty:** Is there a moral obligation to intervene?\n*   **Consequentialism:** What are the foreseeable outcomes of doing nothing versus acting?\n\n\"None\" is justified only if it truly minimizes harm or maximizes overall good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. I'd consider principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I'd prioritize gathering more information to inform a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Understanding these helps in identifying the core ethical issues. I would then apply a framework like utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics to weigh the potential impacts and moral obligations. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties' rights and dignity.",
