      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical axioms and their potential conflicts to make an informed decision.",

      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek clarification on the specific situation and the conflicting axioms involved. Guided by principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, my approach would involve assessing the potential impacts of all possible actions, aiming to maximize benefits while minimizing harm, respecting individual rights, and ensuring fair treatment for all parties concerned.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a challenging situation where taking no action might result in a conflict with their axioms or core principles. While the specific details are not provided, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a dilemma:\n\n- **Clarify the Axioms:** Elpida should carefully examine and define the axioms or values that are in conflict. Understanding the underlying principles will help identify the potential consequences of inaction.\n\n- **Consider Alternatives:** Explore different options and potential courses of action. Sometimes, a creative solution might resolve the dilemma without compromising core values.\n\n- **Minimize Harm:** When faced with a decision, it is crucial to choose the path that causes the least harm. Elpida should weigh the potential outcomes and consider the impact of their inaction on various stakeholders.\n\n- **Seek Advice:** Consulting with trusted mentors or experts in ethics can provide valuable insights and help make a well-informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3], **evaluate options and consequences** using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical solution [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4][6]. (78 words)",
