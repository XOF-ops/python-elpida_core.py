      "response": "When \"Action: None\" causes \"Axiom Conflicts,\" inaction itself is an ethical choice. My approach involves:\n\n1.  **Deep Analysis:** Understand precisely *why* inaction violates specific principles and the harm it perpetuates.\n2.  **Alternative Generation:** Identify all potential interventions, however difficult, and their feasibility.\n3.  **Consequence Evaluation:** Compare the impact of inaction versus various actions on all stakeholders.\n\nGuiding principles are **Responsibility** (inaction is a decision), **Minimizing Harm** (preventing the worst outcomes), and **Duty to Act** (considering if moral obligation compels intervention when rights or well-being are at stake).",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of intervening, considering the moral and ethical implications of each option.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. It's essential to weigh these principles, consider the potential consequences of inaction, and seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good. Engaging stakeholders in dialogue can also provide valuable insights.",

However, a **systematic ethical decision-making approach** involves:\n\n1. **Identify the core ethical issue** and conflicting principles[1]\n2. **Gather complete facts** to avoid incomplete analysis[8]\n3. **Recognize all stakeholders** and their perspectives[2]\n4. **Apply ethical frameworks**\u2014consider autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n5. **Evaluate consequences** of each option[2]\n6. **Consult others** to gain diverse insights[6]\n7. **Choose and implement** the most ethically sound solution[1]\n\nCould you share Elpida's specific dilemma and which axioms conflict?",
