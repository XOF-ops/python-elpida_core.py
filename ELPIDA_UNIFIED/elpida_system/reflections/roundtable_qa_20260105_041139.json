    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the competing values to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma from Elpida with no action specified and axiom conflicts, it's crucial to first identify the core ethical principles at stake, such as justice, autonomy, and non-maleficence. I would gather all relevant information, consider the perspectives of all stakeholders, and assess the potential outcomes of different actions. Guided by the principle of proportionality, I would choose the action that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm, ensuring that my decision respects the dignity and rights of all involved.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in an unresolved conflict between two important principles or values. To navigate this dilemma, it's crucial to consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Axioms**: Understand the specific principles or values at odds. Without knowing the exact nature of the conflict, it's challenging to make an informed decision. Are these principles related to honesty, fairness, justice, or something else?\n\n2. **Prioritize Values**: Once the conflicting axioms are identified, evaluate their relative importance in the given context. Some principles might hold more weight depending on the situation and potential consequences. \n\n3. **Explore Alternatives**: Look for creative solutions or compromises that can honor both values to some extent. Is there a middle ground or an alternative action that could mitigate the conflict? \n\nMaking ethical decisions often involves balancing multiple considerations and seeking the option that causes the least harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate competing values using principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**, assess consequences via frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology), then select and implement the most ethical option with transparency and review.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles: fairness, harm avoidance, well-being promotion, and rights respect to balance impacts.[3][4] (68 words)",
