      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential benefits and harms of inaction and consider alternative courses of action to resolve the dilemma in an ethical manner.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is proposed, it's crucial to start by identifying the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would consider foundational ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics to guide my analysis. The goal is to understand the potential impacts of all possible actions and inactions, ensuring that the decision respects autonomy, promotes justice, and minimizes harm. Engaging stakeholders in the conversation can also provide valuable perspectives and insights.",
