      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

Guided by principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the potential consequences of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and aligns with ethical standards. If more details are provided, I can offer a more specific approach.",
