      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action, I consider the potential consequences of inaction. I'm guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking a proactive stance, considering the ethical implications of each option to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand the perspectives and values of all parties. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while upholding integrity and ethical consistency. If further context is provided, a more tailored approach can be developed.",
