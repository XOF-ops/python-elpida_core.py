      "success": true,
      "response": "When \"Action: None\" directly leads to Axiom Conflicts, the ethical dilemma is rooted in the responsibility to act. My approach would focus on:\n\n1.  **Identify Specific Conflicts:** Clearly define *which* axioms are violated by inaction and their severity.\n2.  **Analyze Consequences:** Evaluate the short-term and long-term impact of continued inaction versus potential interventions.\n3.  **Prioritize Axioms:** If all axioms cannot be upheld, determine which hold paramount importance in the given context.\n\nGuiding principles: **Consequentialism** (seeking the outcome that minimizes harm and maximizes well-being) and **Deontology** (recognizing a duty to uphold fundamental principles, even if it requires difficult action). Inaction is rarely the ethical choice when it actively causes principle violations.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and balance individual rights with the greater good, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma from ELPIDA with no specific action required, I would first clarify the underlying issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, responsibility, and respect for all parties, I would seek to understand the core values at conflict.

Guiding principles: **autonomy, justice, non-maleficence, and beneficence**[5][6], prioritizing harm prevention and fairness[3]. (78 words)",
