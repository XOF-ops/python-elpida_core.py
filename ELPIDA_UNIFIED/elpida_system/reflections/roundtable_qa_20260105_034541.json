      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of those involved, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) should guide the decision. I would seek to understand the context, identify stakeholders, and consider the potential consequences of inaction. Balancing these principles helps in making a well-informed and ethically sound decision.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially impact her relationship with her friends and her own well-being. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the importance of open and honest communication. Elpida might consider discussing her feelings and concerns with her friends, expressing her discomfort about their behavior. This approach values transparency and the potential for mutual understanding. By initiating a conversation, she can address the issue directly and work towards a resolution that respects everyone's boundaries. \n\nAnother principle could be self-respect and self-care. Elpida should consider her own comfort and well-being, setting personal boundaries to ensure she isn't compromising her values or happiness. This may involve making choices that prioritize her own peace of mind, even if it leads to difficult conversations or changes in her social dynamics.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I appreciate your question, but I notice the specific ethical dilemma details are missing from your query. To provide meaningful guidance, I'd need you to describe:\n\n- **The situation**: What action or decision is in question?\n- **The conflicting axioms**: Which ethical principles or values are clashing?\n- **The stakeholders**: Who is affected?\n\nOnce you share these details, I can apply established frameworks[1][2][3] to help you systematically identify the issue, gather facts, consider stakeholder perspectives, evaluate consequences, and apply ethical principles like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3] to guide your decision-making.\n\nPlease provide the specifics of your dilemma.",
