      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms from Elpida, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are also crucial. If more details are provided, a more tailored approach can be developed.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. \n\nTo approach this dilemma, Elpida should consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Responsibility**: Elpida must evaluate the consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can be a choice that carries significant implications. Understanding the potential outcomes is crucial.\n\n2. **Proactivity**: Instead of being a passive observer, Elpida should consider taking proactive steps. Exploring alternatives, gathering more information, or seeking expert advice might help identify a course of action that aligns with her values.\n\n3. **Ethical Reflection**: Reflecting on the underlying ethical principles at stake can guide decision-making. Elpida should consider the values she holds dear and how they apply to this situation. Balancing the potential conflicts between different axioms is essential.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions[2][7]. (78 words)",
