    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking action, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the first step is to clarify the underlying issues and potential conflicts. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest), and justice (fairness and equity), I would seek to understand all perspectives and stakeholders involved. Transparency and communication are crucial to ensure that all parties are informed and that any decision aligns with ethical standards and values. If no action is required, it might be because the situation is already ethically sound or further action could cause unintended harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida's dilemma arises from the potential conflict between taking action and upholding certain axioms or principles. However, without more context or specific details about the situation, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive solution. \n\nWhen faced with ethical dilemmas, it's essential to consider the principles of autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence. These principles can guide decision-making:\n\n- Autonomy: Respecting individuals' rights to make their own choices and decisions.\n- Justice: Ensuring fair treatment and distributing benefits and burdens equitably.\n- Beneficence: Acting in a way that promotes the well-being of others.\n- Non-maleficence: Refraining from causing harm to others.\n\nElpida might consider whether taking action or remaining passive upholds these principles and aligns with her values, while also examining the potential consequences of each choice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the ELPIDA ethical dilemma systematically: **Identify the ethical issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate competing values (e.g., honesty vs. fairness) using frameworks like utilitarianism and justice, assess consequences, and select the option maximizing good while minimizing harm.[1][2][7]\n\nGuiding principles: **Universalism** (duty to all parties), **justice** (fairness and equity), and **consequentialism** (net positive outcomes).[3][7] Consult others for perspective, then act decisively.[1][6] (78 words)",
