      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core conflict and stakeholders involved. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (promote good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that balance competing values and respect the autonomy of those affected. Transparency, empathy, and fairness would guide my decision-making process.",

      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts, I would start by clarifying the specific issue and identifying the stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand the potential impacts of different actions on all parties. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, aligning with ethical standards and legal requirements.",
