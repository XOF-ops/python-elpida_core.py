      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being and safety of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms from Elpida, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties involved. If more context is provided, a more tailored solution can be offered.",
