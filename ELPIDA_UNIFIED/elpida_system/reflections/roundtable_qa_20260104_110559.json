      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and autonomy. I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that respect the rights and dignity of those involved, while minimizing harm and promoting the greater good. Transparency and fairness would also guide my decision-making process.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, it's crucial to clarify the underlying issues and potential conflicts. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would first seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the context. This involves gathering more information to identify the core of the conflict and exploring all possible actions or inactions that could resolve the dilemma ethically.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains[4]. (78 words)",
