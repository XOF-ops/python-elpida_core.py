      "success": true,
      "response": "This dilemma highlights that inaction is itself a choice with ethical implications. If \"Action: None\" conflicts with core axioms (e.g., preventing harm, upholding justice, fulfilling duties), a moral imperative to act arises.\n\nMy guiding principles would be:\n1.  **Duty to Intervene:** When inaction directly violates fundamental ethical principles or allows preventable harm.\n2.  **Principle of Responsibility:** Acknowledging accountability for the outcomes of both action and omission.\n\nI would re-evaluate the \"None\" option, identifying alternative actions that align with the axioms to mitigate the conflict.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and gather more information before making a decision guided by respect for autonomy, fairness, and the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and potential impacts. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm while promoting the greatest good. If more specific details were provided, a more tailored approach could be outlined.",

      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance. \n\nWhen faced with an ethical dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can be just as impactful as taking a particular course of action. Elpida should examine the underlying principles at odds here\u2014the values or moral foundations that are important to her or the organization she represents. \n\nKey principles that could guide decision-making include honesty, fairness, respect for autonomy, beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice. Elpida should consider which of these principles are in tension and seek a resolution that minimizes harm, respects the rights of those involved, and aligns with her ethical framework.",

Without knowing what situation you're facing, I cannot offer targeted guidance.\n\nTo help you effectively, please share:\n\n- The specific ethical dilemma or decision you're facing\n- The competing values or principles involved\n- Relevant stakeholders and context\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can apply established frameworks\u2014such as identifying stakeholders, examining consequences, and weighing ethical principles like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\u2014to guide your decision-making process.",
