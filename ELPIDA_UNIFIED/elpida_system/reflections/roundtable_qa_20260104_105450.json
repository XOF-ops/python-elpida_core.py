      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. I'd consider principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I'd gather more information to determine the best course of action that balances competing values and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm while respecting all parties' rights and values. Dialogue and transparency with all stakeholders are crucial to navigate the conflict ethically.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially cause a conflict with her personal values or ethical principles. While the details are not provided, it seems that Elpida's dilemma revolves around the idea of taking action versus maintaining the status quo. \n\nWhen faced with such a decision, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, not taking action can lead to unintended harm or perpetuate an unjust situation. Elpida should examine whether her inaction might violate any moral obligations or duties she has towards others or herself. \n\nGuiding principles in this case could include the duty of care, where one is responsible for preventing foreseeable harm, and the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the avoidance of causing harm. Elpida's decision should aim to minimize harm and ensure that her actions (or inaction) align with her ethical beliefs.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: identify the issue and stakeholders[1][2], gather unbiased facts[1][6], apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**[3], evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)[2][3], then select and implement the best option with review[1][3]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and well-being for all[3][4]. (78 words)",
