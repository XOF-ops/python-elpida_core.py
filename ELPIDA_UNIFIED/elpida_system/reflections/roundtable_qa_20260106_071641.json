      "success": true,
      "response": "Since no action or details are provided, I'd approach this dilemma by gathering more information about the situation and the conflicting axioms. I'd consider principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good), and weigh the potential consequences of different actions to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, it's crucial to identify the underlying values and principles at stake. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices), I would first seek to understand the context and perspectives involved. This involves gathering more information, engaging in dialogue, and considering the potential consequences of inaction. The goal is to ensure that any decision aligns with these core ethical principles.",
