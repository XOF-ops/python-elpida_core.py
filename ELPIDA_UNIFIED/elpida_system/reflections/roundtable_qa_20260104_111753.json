      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy (individual choice) can guide the decision. I would seek to understand the context, identify stakeholders, and evaluate the potential outcomes of different inactions. The goal is to minimize harm and maximize ethical integrity while respecting all involved parties.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
