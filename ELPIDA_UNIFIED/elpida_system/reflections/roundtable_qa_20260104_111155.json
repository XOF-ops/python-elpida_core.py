      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or inaction, in this situation.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms. Generally, I would apply principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness). The goal is to identify the core ethical issues, weigh the potential consequences, and seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. If more details are provided, a more specific approach can be outlined.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, stakeholders, and competing values[1][2]. Apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**[3], using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology[2][3]. Evaluate consequences, consult others, select the best option, implement transparently, and review outcomes[1][7]. This ensures fairness, integrity, and long-term good[4]. (78 words)",
