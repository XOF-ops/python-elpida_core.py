      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Principles guiding my decision would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect individual rights), and justice (fairness and equality). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it's to maintain the status quo of \"none.\"",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts, it's crucial to first clarify the specific issue at hand. Generally, I would approach such dilemmas by applying the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy. Identifying stakeholders, potential impacts, and aligning with these ethical principles helps in making a well-rounded decision. If you can provide more details about the dilemma, I can offer a more tailored response.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate competing values (e.g., honesty vs. fairness), assess consequences using frameworks like utilitarianism or justice, and consult others for diverse perspectives[1][2][7]. Guiding principles include **universalism** (duty to all parties), **justice** (fairness and equity), and **consequentialism** (maximizing good, minimizing harm)[3][6]. This ensures integrity-aligned decisions[4]. (78 words)",
