      "response": "Given \"Action: None\" directly causes \"Axiom Conflicts,\" my approach would be to first identify the specific axioms being violated and the consequences of inaction. I'd then seek an alternative action that proactively addresses these conflicts and upholds the compromised principles.\n\nGuiding principles:\n*   **Duty to Act:** A moral imperative to intervene when inaction leads to harm or fundamental ethical breaches.\n*   **Principle of Responsibility:** Taking accountability for preventing foreseeable negative outcomes.\n*   **Upholding Core Values:** Prioritizing actions that align with the fundamental axioms, even when challenging.",
