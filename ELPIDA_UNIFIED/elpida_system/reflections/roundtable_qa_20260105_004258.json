    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action taken, I consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I weigh these principles against the potential outcomes, considering the moral implications of inaction and the potential harm or benefit that may result. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equity), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all voices are heard and considered.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action is the primary concern, suggesting a need for proactive decision-making. The principle of responsibility suggests that taking no action might be unethical if it leads to foreseeable harm. The principle of beneficence encourages actions that promote the well-being of others. \n\nOne approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. If remaining passive could result in harm or negatively impact someone's well-being, then taking proactive measures becomes essential. This might involve gathering more information to understand the situation better and then making an informed decision. Prioritizing transparency and open communication can also help navigate such dilemmas, ensuring that all parties involved understand the reasons behind any chosen course of action.",
