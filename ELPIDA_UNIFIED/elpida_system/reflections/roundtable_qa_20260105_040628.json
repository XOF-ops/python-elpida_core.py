      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the core conflict and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice. I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical implications and long-term effects on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. I would seek to understand the context, identify stakeholders, and evaluate potential outcomes to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance. \n\nWhen faced with an ethical dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can be just as significant a decision as taking action. Elpida should examine the underlying principles at odds here and determine which values are most relevant and require protection. For example, if one axiom is related to causing no harm, and the other is about promoting individual freedom, Elpida might consider finding a solution that respects freedom while minimizing potential harm. \n\nA thoughtful and balanced approach, considering all relevant factors, is essential to navigating such dilemmas effectively.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate stakeholders and competing values, apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**, assess consequences, and select the most ethical option with transparent implementation and review.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, drawing from utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics for balanced, defensible decisions.[3][4]",
