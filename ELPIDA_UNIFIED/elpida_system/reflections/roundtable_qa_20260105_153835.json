      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice, I would aim to understand the stakeholders' perspectives and the potential consequences of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity. If more context is provided, I can offer a more specific analysis.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a dilemma:\n\n- **Identify the Axioms:** Understand the underlying values or principles that are in tension. For example, it could be a conflict between personal freedom and community welfare, or privacy versus transparency.\n\n- **Consider Consequences:** Evaluate the potential outcomes of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can have significant implications. Weigh the short-term and long-term effects on various stakeholders.\n\n- **Seek Additional Information:** Elpida might benefit from gathering more data or consulting relevant experts to make an informed decision. Taking no action without proper justification could be problematic.\n\n- **Apply Ethical Frameworks:** Utilize ethical theories like utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics to analyze the situation and determine the most morally justifiable course of action.\n\n- **Minimize Harm:** Prioritize choices that cause the least harm and promote the greatest good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **map stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence) [3][4], **evaluate alternatives** via frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], **assess consequences**, then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains [3][4]. (78 words)",
