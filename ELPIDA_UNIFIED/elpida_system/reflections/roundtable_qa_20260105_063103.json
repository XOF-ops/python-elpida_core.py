      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their importance. I'd consider principles like non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). Since no action is taken, I'd prioritize caution and gather more information to ensure a well-informed decision that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clearly identify the core values and principles at stake. Guided by principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equity), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are also crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered.",
