      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach by identifying the core values at stake. I'd consider principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy, and justice. I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and rights of all parties involved, seeking a balance that respects these principles and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where no action is specified and axiom conflicts are present, the first step is to identify the conflicting principles involved. I would then consider the potential impacts of each possible action on all stakeholders. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good. Transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are also crucial.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
