      "success": true,
      "response": "In the absence of action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the importance of fairness, respect, and responsibility. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), while also respecting autonomy and promoting justice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specified action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the specific context and the nature of the conflicts. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits, while ensuring fairness and respecting all stakeholders' rights and choices. Further details on the specific dilemma would help in providing a more tailored response.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
