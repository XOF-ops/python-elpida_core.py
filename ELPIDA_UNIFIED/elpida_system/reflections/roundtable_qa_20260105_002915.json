      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and interests at stake. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the axiom conflicts and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or inaction, in this situation.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or values. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. It's essential to consider all stakeholders and potential outcomes, aiming for a resolution that aligns with these ethical principles while minimizing harm and promoting the greater good.",
