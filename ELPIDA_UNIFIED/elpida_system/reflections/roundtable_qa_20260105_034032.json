    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action taken, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all voices are heard and considered.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a challenging situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important axioms or principles. To navigate this dilemma, Elpida should consider the following:\n\n1. **Clarify the Axioms**: Understanding the specific axioms or values at odds is crucial. Identifying and defining these conflicting principles will provide a framework for decision-making.\n\n2. **Prioritize Values**: Elpida should reflect on the relative importance of each axiom. Some principles might be more fundamental or have greater ethical significance. Prioritizing values can help determine which course of action aligns with the most essential moral obligations.\n\n3. **Explore Alternatives**: It's worth considering if there are any alternative actions that could resolve the conflict. Exploring creative solutions or compromises might reveal a way to honour both axioms without compromising either. \n\nThe key is to make a thoughtful decision that minimizes harm and upholds the most critical ethical standards.",
