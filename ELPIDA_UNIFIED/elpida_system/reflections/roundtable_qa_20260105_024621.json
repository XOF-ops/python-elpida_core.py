      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this ethical dilemma, I would first clarify the specific context and stakeholders involved. The guiding principles would include transparency, accountability, and the well-being of those affected. It's crucial to weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the ethical implications of any possible actions. If inaction could lead to harm, proactive measures should be considered. However, any decision should be thoroughly documented and justified to maintain integrity and trust.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance on navigating ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the underlying values at stake. Elpida should examine the principles that are in tension and try to find a resolution that minimizes harm and respects all relevant ethical considerations. This might involve seeking additional information, consulting ethical guidelines or experts, and carefully weighing the potential outcomes. Prioritizing transparency, fairness, and the well-being of all involved parties can help guide Elpida toward an ethically justifiable decision.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence) [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** [7], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][3]. Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions [7]. (78 words)",
