      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. I'd consider principles like respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is taken, I'd prioritize minimizing harm and promoting the well-being of those involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and transparency. Further context is needed to make a specific decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the core ethical issues involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and potential impacts. This foundational analysis helps in formulating a balanced and ethically sound approach.",
