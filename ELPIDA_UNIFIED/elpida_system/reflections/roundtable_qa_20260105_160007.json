      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the axioms in conflict and weighing their relative importance. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is outlined, it's crucial to consider core ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy. Without a clear conflict or scenario, the focus should be on maintaining integrity and transparency in all actions. If faced with a specific issue, these principles would guide the assessment and decision-making process to ensure a balanced and ethical outcome.",
