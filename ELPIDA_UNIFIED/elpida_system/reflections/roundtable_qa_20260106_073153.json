      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd identify the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, considering the potential impact on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the context and identify the conflicting principles. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the stakeholders involved and the potential consequences of each possible action. The goal is to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and ensuring fairness.",
