      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach this dilemma by gathering context and clarifying the situation. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd also consider fairness, justice, and the potential consequences of inaction. Further details are necessary to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing the dilemma from Elpida, the first step is to identify the conflicting axioms and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence and beneficence, I would assess the potential harm and benefits of taking action versus inaction. Transparency and communication with all parties are crucial to ensure informed decision-making. If inaction poses a greater risk of harm, then a carefully considered intervention may be necessary, aligned with ethical guidelines and legal standards.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially lead to two conflicting outcomes, both guided by important ethical principles. \n\nOn one hand, the principle of non-maleficence suggests that Elpida should avoid causing harm by not taking any action, especially if there is uncertainty about the consequences. This is a cautious approach to ensure no one is harmed by her actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the principle of beneficence implies that Elpida has a duty to do good and help others. By not acting, she might miss an opportunity to improve someone's life, which could be considered unethical in itself. \n\nTo resolve this, Elpida should gather more information to make an informed decision. She could consider the potential risks and benefits, and perhaps seek expert advice to ensure her decision aligns with the greatest good, while also minimizing potential harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would follow a systematic ethical decision-making framework: identify the ethical issue and stakeholders[1][2], gather unbiased facts[1][7], apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**[3], evaluate alternatives and consequences[2][3], then select and implement the most ethical option with review[1][3]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
