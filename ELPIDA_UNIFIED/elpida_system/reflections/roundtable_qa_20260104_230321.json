      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach the dilemma by gathering context and clarifying the situation. I'd consider principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for all parties involved. I'd also evaluate potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against the potential benefits of taking a course of action, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those affected. Further details are necessary to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida, it's crucial to clarify the specific conflict or situation involved. However, generally, I would approach it by prioritizing principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual freedom), and justice (fairness). The goal is to find a balance that minimizes harm while maximizing benefits, respecting all parties' rights and ensuring fair treatment. If more details are provided, a more tailored response can be given.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida seems to be facing a situation where there might be a conflict between different ethical principles or values, but the specific details are unclear. When faced with an ethical dilemma, it's important to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Ethical Principles**: Determine the values at stake, such as honesty, fairness, respect for autonomy, or justice. \n\n2. **Analyze the Consequences**: Consider the potential outcomes and impacts of each possible action on all affected parties. \n\n3. **Apply Ethical Theories**: Utilitarianism (maximizing overall happiness), deontology (duty-based ethics), or virtue ethics (focusing on moral character) can provide different perspectives. \n\n4. **Seek Additional Information**: More details might be needed to make an informed decision. Elpida should gather facts and clarify the situation to ensure a thorough understanding. \n\n5. **Consult and Discuss**: Engaging in dialogue with colleagues, mentors, or ethics experts can provide valuable insights and different viewpoints.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**[1][2], gather unbiased facts**[1][7], apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**[3], evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)**[2][3][4], then select, implement, and review the best option**[1][3]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains.[3][4] (78 words)",
