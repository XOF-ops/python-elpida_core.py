      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, making a decision that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the first step is to clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by identifying and understanding these principles, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders affected. My decision would be guided by seeking a balance that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting the rights and dignity of all parties involved. If further clarification is needed, I would seek additional information or consult ethical frameworks.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict between different ethical principles. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance on navigating ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can have significant implications and may violate ethical principles such as causing harm or failing to prevent it. Elpida should examine the values at stake, such as honesty, fairness, respect for autonomy, or justice, and prioritize those that are most relevant to the situation. \n\nA thoughtful approach involves weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option, considering alternative actions, and seeking input from relevant stakeholders to make an informed decision that aligns with the greatest ethical good.",
