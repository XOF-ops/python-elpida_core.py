      "response": "Faced with \"Action: None\" leading to \"Axiom Conflicts,\" I would immediately recognize that inaction is an ethically significant choice. My approach involves:\n\n1.  **Identifying the specific axioms** being violated by passivity.\n2.  **Assessing the consequences** of continued inaction versus potential interventions.\n\nGuiding principles:\n*   **Active Responsibility:** Acknowledging a duty to prevent harm or uphold fundamental values.\n*   **Minimizing Harm/Maximizing Ethical Compliance:** Prioritizing actions that resolve the axiom conflicts, rather than allowing inaction to persist.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm) and benevolence (do good). Since the action is \"none,\" I would weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking a different course of action, and consider alternative solutions that balance competing values and minimize harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma, I would first clarify the specific ethical principles in conflict. Key principles might include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy. Without a specific action, the focus is on understanding the context and stakeholders involved. I would gather more information to assess the potential impacts and consider a course of action that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm, ensuring that all parties' rights and well-being are respected.",
