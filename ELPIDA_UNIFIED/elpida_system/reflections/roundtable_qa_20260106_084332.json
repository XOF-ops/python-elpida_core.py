      "success": true,
      "response": "When 'Action: None' leads to 'Axiom Conflicts,' the dilemma demands proactive engagement. My approach would be:\n1.  **Identify & Prioritize:** Clearly define the conflicting axioms and assess their relative importance in this context.\n2.  **Analyze Consequences:** Evaluate the impact of continued inaction versus potential actions on all stakeholders.\n3.  **Seek Resolution/Mitigation:** Explore actions that minimize harm, uphold core duties, or find a creative compromise.\n\nGuiding principles include **consequentialism** (outcomes), **deontology** (duties/rules), and **harm reduction**. Inaction is itself a choice with ethical weight, often perpetuating conflict rather than resolving it.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by analyzing the axiom conflicts and identifying the core ethical issue. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the moral implications of each possible course of action, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the first step is to clarify the underlying values and principles in conflict. Guided by principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the context and stakeholders involved. The goal is to find a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity. If you can provide more details, I can offer a more tailored response.",
