      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical principles and values at stake.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action presented and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equity), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered.",
