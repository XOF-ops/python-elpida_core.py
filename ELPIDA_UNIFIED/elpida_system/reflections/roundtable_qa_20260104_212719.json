      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying axioms and values at conflict. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking a stance, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Next, I would assess the potential impacts of each possible action on all stakeholders. My decision would be guided by striving for the greatest good while minimizing harm, ensuring transparency, and respecting the dignity and rights of all individuals affected. If more specific details were provided, a more tailored approach could be outlined.",
