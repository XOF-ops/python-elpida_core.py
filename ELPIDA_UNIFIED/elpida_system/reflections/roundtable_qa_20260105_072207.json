      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I consider the context of ELPIDA and potential axioms in conflict. I'm guided by principles of respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm), weighing the potential consequences of inaction and considering the ethical implications of each possible course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the key is to analyze the underlying axioms or values in conflict. I would start by identifying and clarifying these values, such as fairness, autonomy, or harm prevention. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders involved to understand the potential impacts of different resolutions. Guided by principles like utilitarianism (maximizing overall good) and deontology (adhering to moral duties), I would seek a balanced solution that respects all values while minimizing harm.",
