      "response": "This dilemma highlights that inaction (\"Action: None\") itself carries ethical weight, especially when it leads to \"Axiom Conflicts.\" My approach is to treat axiom conflicts as serious violations demanding intervention.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Responsibility:** One bears responsibility for the consequences of inaction when they have the capacity to prevent harm or uphold core values.\n2.  **Deontology/Duty:** Axioms often represent duties or fundamental principles; conflicts imply a breach that demands rectification.\n3.  **Preventative Ethics:** The ethical imperative to act to prevent or mitigate negative outcomes arising from these conflicts.\n\nTherefore, proactively identifying and addressing the specific axiom conflicts is paramount, necessitating a shift from \"None\" to deliberate action.",
