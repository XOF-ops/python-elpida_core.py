      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach by identifying the conflicting principles and weighing their moral implications. I'd consider the context, potential consequences, and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). A thorough analysis would help resolve the dilemma in an ethically justifiable manner.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, it's crucial to clarify the underlying issues and potential conflicts. Guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and respect for autonomy, I would first seek to understand the context and stakeholders involved. This involves gathering more information to identify the core ethical concerns. From there, I would aim to facilitate a dialogue that explores all perspectives, ensuring that any decision respects human rights and promotes the greater good.",

Generally, ethical decision-making involves:\n\n- **Identifying the issue** and affected stakeholders[1][2]\n- **Gathering facts** to understand context[1]\n- **Applying ethical principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n- **Evaluating consequences** of each option[2]\n- **Selecting the most ethical solution** aligned with your values[1]\n\nPlease describe the specific dilemma, and I'll help you navigate it systematically.",
