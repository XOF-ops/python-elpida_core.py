      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. I'd be guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), weighing the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking a different course of action. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would analyze the potential impacts of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all stakeholders' rights and ensuring fairness. If more context is provided, a more specific approach can be outlined.",
