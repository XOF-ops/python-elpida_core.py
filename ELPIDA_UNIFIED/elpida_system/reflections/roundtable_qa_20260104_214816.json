      "success": true,
      "response": "Since no action is specified, I'd gather more information to understand the context. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against possible alternatives, prioritizing the well-being and dignity of individuals involved. Further details are necessary to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting principles. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders involved, and potential outcomes. This helps in balancing the conflicting axioms and making a well-informed, ethical decision.",
