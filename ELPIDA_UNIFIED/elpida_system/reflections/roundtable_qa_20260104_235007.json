    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the axiom conflicts and considering the context. Since no action is specified, I prioritize principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would gather more information to understand the situation and potential consequences, then apply ethical frameworks to guide my decision, weighing the potential harm and benefits of different actions.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and no specific axioms are provided, it's crucial to consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). If taking no action ensures no harm and potentially supports a greater good, it might be justifiable. However, it's also important to assess whether inaction could lead to harm or missed opportunities for positive impact. Transparency and stakeholder communication are key to ensuring that the decision is ethically sound and understood.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) may have unintentionally caused a conflict between two important principles: honesty and respect for privacy. \n\nTo resolve this dilemma, Elpida could consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Assess the situation**: Understand the full context and gather information. Does the friend have a valid reason for not wanting to share the information? Are there potential consequences for revealing the secret?\n\n2. **Consider the principles**: Weigh the importance of honesty in maintaining trust against the respect for individual privacy. Is there a way to honor both principles without causing harm?\n\n3. **Explore alternatives**: Elpida could discuss the matter with her friend, expressing her dilemma and seeking a solution together. They might find a way to disclose the information while respecting privacy, or find an alternative solution that alleviates the conflict.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate options using principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, and assess consequences via frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology).[1][2][3] Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and well-being** while fostering transparent discussion. Select, implement, and review the most ethical solution.[7][9] (68 words)",
