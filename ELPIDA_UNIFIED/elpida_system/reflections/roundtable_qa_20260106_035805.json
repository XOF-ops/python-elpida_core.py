      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the axiom conflicts and evaluating the ethical implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the moral obligations to act, prioritizing the well-being and safety of individuals involved. Further information about the specific conflict would be necessary to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, I would first clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. My approach would be guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy (individual choice). I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences, aiming to find a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties involved.",

Guiding principles include **autonomy, justice, fairness, and maximizing good while minimizing harm**[2][3], prioritizing integrity over self-interest. (78 words)",
