      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context, I'd consider general ethical principles like respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I'd weigh potential consequences and prioritize the well-being and autonomy of individuals involved, seeking a balance between competing values and axioms to guide my decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the key is to clarify and understand the underlying values and principles at stake. Guided by principles such as transparency, fairness, and respect for autonomy, I would start by identifying the conflicting axioms and their implications. The next step would be to engage in a thoughtful dialogue with all stakeholders to explore potential resolutions that align with these core values, ensuring that any decision respects the dignity and rights of everyone involved.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term good over short-term gains[4][3]. (78 words)",
