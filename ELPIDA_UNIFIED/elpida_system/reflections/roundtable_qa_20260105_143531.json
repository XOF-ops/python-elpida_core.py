      "success": true,
      "response": "To approach this, first explicitly identify the conflicting axioms and the full consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include consequentialism (minimizing harm, maximizing well-being) and deontology (upholding duties violated by inaction).\n\nSince \"Action: None\" creates axiom conflicts, ethical responsibility demands active consideration of alternatives. Prioritize the axiom preventing the greatest harm or upholding fundamental rights. Seek a course of action that actively reconciles conflicts and mitigates the worst outcomes, rather than allowing inaction to persist.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action taken, I'd consider the moral principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that balance competing values and promote the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the situation and the conflicting axioms. My approach would be guided by principles of transparency, harm minimization, and respect for autonomy. I would aim to gather more information, consider the perspectives of all stakeholders, and explore potential compromises or alternative solutions that align with ethical standards and values. If further details are provided, I can offer a more specific response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or inactions could potentially cause harm to others. The absence of specific axiom conflicts suggests that the dilemma might lie in identifying the relevant ethical principles at play. \n\nElpida should consider the following principles to guide her decision-making process:\n\n1. Duty of Care: Does Elpida have a responsibility to ensure the well-being of those who might be affected by her actions or inactions?\n\n2. Harm Prevention: Is there a potential risk of harm, and if so, how can Elpida minimize or mitigate it?\n\n3. Justice and Fairness: Are there any unfair consequences resulting from her decision, and how can she ensure a just outcome for all involved parties?\n\nBy carefully evaluating the situation through these ethical lenses, Elpida can make an informed decision that aligns with her moral obligations.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**[1][2], gather unbiased facts**[1][7], apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**[3], and evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)**[2][3]. Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and maximizing well-being while fostering dialogue**[1][4]. Select, implement, and review the most ethical option transparently**[3][7].
