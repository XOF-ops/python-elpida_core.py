      "response": "If \"Action: None\" yields \"Axiom Conflicts: None,\" my approach is to determine no intervention is required. This indicates inaction is ethically permissible, causes no harm, and resolves no current conflicts, making further action unnecessary.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Non-maleficence:** No harm results from inaction.\n2.  **Sufficiency:** No ethical problem demands a solution.\n3.  **Absence of Obligation:** Without conflict, there's no moral imperative to act.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a challenging situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. When faced with such a dilemma, it is essential to consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Clarity and Transparency**: Elpida should gather all relevant information to understand the consequences of inaction. Being transparent about the potential outcomes with all involved parties is crucial.\n\n2. **Ethical Responsibility**: Elpida must consider the ethical implications of their decision, especially if their inaction could cause harm or affect others negatively. \n\n3. **Timely Decision-Making**: While careful consideration is essential, delaying the decision indefinitely may exacerbate the situation. A balanced approach is required to make a timely decision without rushing into potential pitfalls.",
