      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles against the potential outcomes of inaction to determine the most ethical course.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clearly identify the core values and principles at stake. Guided by principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, and justice, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and respects all parties involved. Transparency and communication are crucial to ensure that all perspectives are considered and that any decision is well-informed and ethically justifiable.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term good** over short-term gains[4][5]. (78 words)",
