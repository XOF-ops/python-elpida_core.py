      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential harm or benefits of alternative actions, considering the ethical principles and values at stake. Ultimately, I'd choose the course of action that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while respecting all stakeholders' rights and promoting fairness. Open dialogue and transparency in decision-making processes can help navigate such complexities.",
