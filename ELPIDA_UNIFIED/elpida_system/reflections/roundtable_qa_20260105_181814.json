      "success": true,
      "response": "Approaching \"Action: None\" causing \"Axiom Conflicts\" requires rejecting inaction. The guiding principle is an ethical responsibility to intervene when passivity violates fundamental values or causes harm.\n\nFirst, analyze the specific axioms in conflict to understand the root issue. Then, proactively identify and evaluate alternative actions that minimize these conflicts, uphold higher-priority values (e.g., preventing suffering), and fulfill neglected duties. The aim is always to find a constructive, ethically sound intervention, not to accept inaction.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach this dilemma by seeking clarification on the situation and identifying the conflicting axioms. I'd then apply ethical principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good) to guide my decision-making. Transparency and fairness would also be considered in resolving the dilemma.",

However, a systematic approach would involve:\n\n1. **Identify the ethical issue** clearly[1]\n2. **Gather facts** and stakeholder perspectives[2]\n3. **Apply ethical principles**: autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n4. **Consider consequences** of each option[2]\n5. **Consult others** for diverse insights[6]\n6. **Choose the option** balancing ethics, practicality, and stakeholder impact[3]\n\nKey guiding principles include respecting individual rights, ensuring fairness, promoting well-being, and avoiding harm[3]. The best solution aligns with your core values while minimizing negative outcomes[1].\n\nCould you share Elpida's specific situation?",
