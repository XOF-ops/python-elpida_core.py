    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being and autonomy of those involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for human rights.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma, I would first clarify the specific ethical principles in conflict. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), I would assess the potential impacts of taking no action. If inaction could lead to harm, I would explore alternative actions that align with ethical standards. Transparency and stakeholder communication are also crucial to ensure all parties are informed and can provide input. This approach balances the need to avoid harm with the responsibility to act ethically.",

      "response": "I'd need more details about Elpida's specific situation to provide tailored guidance. However, a systematic approach to ethical dilemmas involves:[1]\n\n1. **Identify the ethical issue** clearly[1]\n2. **Gather relevant facts** and perspectives[2]\n3. **Identify stakeholders** and their interests[1]\n4. **Apply ethical principles**: autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n5. **Evaluate consequences** of each option[2]\n6. **Consult others** for diverse perspectives[1]\n7. **Choose and implement** the most ethically sound solution[1]\n\nCould you share Elpida's specific dilemma and conflicting axioms? This will help me offer more targeted ethical guidance.",
