      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being and autonomy of those involved, guided by fairness, respect, and compassion.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of different courses of action. My decision would be guided by a principle of proportionality, aiming to maximize benefits while minimizing harm, and ensuring that the chosen path aligns with the overarching goal of promoting good and reducing suffering.",
