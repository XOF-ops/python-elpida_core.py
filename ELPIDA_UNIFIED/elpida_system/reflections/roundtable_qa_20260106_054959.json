      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core conflict and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical implications of each option to make a decision that promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and potential impacts. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties' rights and values.",
