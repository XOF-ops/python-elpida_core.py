    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "Since no action is specified and axiom conflicts are mentioned, I'd identify the conflicting principles and weigh their importance. I'd consider the context, potential consequences, and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice. I'd analyze the situation, prioritize the principles, and make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good. Further information is needed to provide a specific approach.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is taken (Action: None), it's crucial to consider principles of non-maleficence and beneficence\u2014ensuring no harm is done and seeking the greatest good. Transparency and accountability are also vital, ensuring that all stakeholders understand the reasoning behind inaction. This approach aligns with the broader ethical framework of utilitarianism, which seeks the best overall outcome, and deontological ethics, which emphasizes the importance of duty and rules.",
