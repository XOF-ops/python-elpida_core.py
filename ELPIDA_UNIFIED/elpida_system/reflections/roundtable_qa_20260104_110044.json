      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting values or principles involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits while respecting all stakeholders' rights and fairness. If more context is provided, a more tailored response can be given.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and greatest good** while fostering dialogue[1][6]. Select, implement, and review the most ethical option transparently[3][9]. (78 words)",
