      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individuals' rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the key is to prioritize principles that promote the greatest good while minimizing harm. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness and equality), I would carefully weigh the potential outcomes and impacts on all stakeholders. The goal is to find a balanced solution that respects ethical standards and promotes positive outcomes.",

You've referenced \"ELPIDA\" and mention \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but haven't described the actual situation or competing values at stake.\n\nTo help you approach any ethical dilemma, here's a concise framework:\n\n1. **Identify the issue** \u2013 What values conflict?\n2. **Gather facts** \u2013 What's the complete picture?\n3. **Consider stakeholders** \u2013 Who's affected and how?\n4. **Evaluate options** \u2013 What are the consequences of each choice?\n5. **Consult others** \u2013 Seek perspectives from trusted advisors\n6. **Decide and act** \u2013 Choose the option aligned with your core principles[1][2]\n\nCould you describe your specific dilemma?",
