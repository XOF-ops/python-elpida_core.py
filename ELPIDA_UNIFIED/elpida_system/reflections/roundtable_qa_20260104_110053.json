      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach this dilemma by seeking clarification on the context and stakes involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh potential consequences, consider multiple perspectives, and prioritize transparency and fairness in making a decision. Further details are necessary to determine the best course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to evaluate the underlying principles at stake. Guided by the harm principle, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. If inaction leads to greater harm, then exploring alternative actions that minimize harm while respecting autonomy and justice becomes necessary. The goal is to find a balance that respects all involved parties' rights and values, aiming for the most ethically sound outcome.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
