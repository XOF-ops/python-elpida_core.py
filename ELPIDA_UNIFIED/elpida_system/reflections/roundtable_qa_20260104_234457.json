    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential harm or benefits of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that align with these principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is outlined and there are axiom conflicts, the guiding principles are transparency, harm minimization, and stakeholder consideration. I would start by clearly defining the conflicting axioms to understand the core of the dilemma. Next, I would assess the potential impacts on all stakeholders to identify the least harmful path. Finally, I would seek input from diverse perspectives to ensure a well-rounded decision-making process.",

To apply ethical decision-making frameworks effectively, I need the actual dilemma you're facing.\n\nHowever, here's how to approach **any** ethical dilemma:\n\n1. **Identify the issue** and conflicting values[1][2]\n2. **Gather facts** without bias[1]\n3. **Identify stakeholders** and their impacts[1]\n4. **Apply ethical principles**: autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence[3]\n5. **Evaluate consequences** short and long-term[2]\n6. **Consult others** and choose the most ethical option[6]\n\nPlease share the specific dilemma so I can provide targeted guidance.",
