Principles guiding my decision include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all voices are heard and considered. The goal is to find a resolution that aligns with ethical standards and respects all parties.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict between two important principles or values. To navigate this dilemma, Elpida could consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the Axioms: Understand the specific axioms or principles that are in tension. One might be related to taking initiative and responsibility, while the other could be about avoiding unnecessary risks or harm. \n\n2. Weigh the Consequences: Evaluate the potential outcomes of inaction. Consider if not acting could potentially lead to more harm or if it might resolve the issue without intervention. \n\n3. Seek Alternative Solutions: Explore other options or creative solutions that could address the root cause of the dilemma without directly contradicting either axiom. \n\nElpida's decision should aim to minimize harm, respect ethical principles, and find a balanced approach that aligns with the greater good. Transparency and careful consideration of the implications are key to making an informed choice.",

Without knowing the specific scenario, stakeholders involved, or the competing values at stake, I cannot provide targeted guidance.\n\nTo help you effectively, please share:\n\n- **The situation:** What decision or action is being considered?\n- **The conflict:** What values or principles are in tension?\n- **The stakeholders:** Who is affected?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can apply established ethical decision-making frameworks\u2014such as identifying key principles, evaluating consequences, and considering stakeholder perspectives\u2014to guide your approach.",
