Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where no action is specified and there are axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the specific context and the conflicting axioms involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits while respecting all parties' rights and values.Dialogue and transparency with all stakeholders are crucial to navigate such complex situations ethically.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a dilemma:\n\n- **Identify the Axioms:** Determine the specific principles or values at odds with each other. Understanding the nature of the conflict is crucial.\n\n- **Consider Consequences:** Evaluate the potential outcomes of inaction. Sometimes, taking no action can have significant implications. Weigh the short-term and long-term effects on various stakeholders.\n\n- **Seek Additional Information:** Elpida might consider gathering more data or consulting relevant experts to make an informed decision. This could provide clarity and help identify alternative solutions.\n\n- **Apply Ethical Frameworks:** Utilize ethical theories like deontology (duty-based ethics) or utilitarianism (consequence-based ethics) to analyze the dilemma and make a justifiable choice.\n\n- **Minimize Harm:** When in doubt, a common ethical principle is to choose the option that causes the least harm or maximizes overall well-being.",
