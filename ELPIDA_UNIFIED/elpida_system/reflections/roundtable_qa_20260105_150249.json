      "response": "\"Action: None\" isn't passive; it's a choice with consequences. When it causes Axiom Conflicts, the primary approach is to recognize that *inaction itself is an ethical decision*.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Duty to Act:** Evaluate if a moral duty exists to intervene, especially when axioms (fundamental principles like preventing harm or upholding justice) are being violated.\n2.  **Consequentialism:** Assess the foreseeable outcomes of continued inaction versus various interventions. Choose the action (or least harmful inaction) that best upholds the axioms and minimizes negative impact.\n3.  **Responsibility:** Acknowledge responsibility for the situation, even if not directly caused, when inaction permits harm or injustice.\n\nThe goal is to find an *action* that resolves or mitigates the axiom conflicts.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether to take action at all.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, or non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of different responses. My decision would be guided by the principle of proportionality\u2014balancing the importance of each value and minimizing harm. Transparency and stakeholder engagement can also help in navigating complex ethical issues.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd need clarification on your specific situation to provide tailored guidance. However, here's a general approach based on ethical decision-making frameworks:\n\n1. **Identify the core conflict** \u2013 What competing values or principles clash?\n2. **Gather facts** \u2013 Separate assumptions from evidence\n3. **Consider stakeholders** \u2013 Who is affected and how?\n4. **Apply ethical principles** \u2013 Use frameworks like justice (fairness), autonomy (respect), or consequences (impact)\n5. **Evaluate options** \u2013 Weigh short and long-term effects\n6. **Seek input** \u2013 Consult trusted advisors for perspective\n7. **Act with integrity** \u2013 Choose the option most aligned with your core values\n\nCould you share the specific axiom conflicts you're facing? That would allow for more precise guidance.",
