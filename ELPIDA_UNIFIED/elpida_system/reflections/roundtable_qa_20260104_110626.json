      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context provided, I consider general ethical principles: respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. I would gather more information to understand the situation and weigh the potential consequences of different actions, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and a commitment to doing no harm.",

Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness).

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains [3][6]. (78 words)",
