      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and balance individual rights with the greater good, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the first step is to clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand the context and stakeholders affected. The goal is to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting the rights and choices of all involved. Further details on the specific conflict would help in providing a more tailored response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging choice, especially if she has a strong sense of justice and fairness. The principle of 'justice' could guide her decision-making process, focusing on ensuring fair treatment and outcomes for all involved. \n\nElpida could consider the potential consequences of inaction, including the possibility of allowing an unjust situation to persist. She might weigh the importance of upholding justice against other factors like personal risk or the potential for unintended consequences. \n\nTaking a measured approach, Elpida could gather more information to understand the situation better and explore alternatives. This could involve seeking advice from trusted sources or experts to make an informed decision that aligns with her ethical values while minimizing harm.",
