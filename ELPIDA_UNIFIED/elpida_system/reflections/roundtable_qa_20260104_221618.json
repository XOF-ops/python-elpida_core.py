      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action or axiom conflicts, I'd approach this dilemma by seeking more information. I'd consider principles of transparency, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I'd ask questions to clarify the situation, identify potential stakeholders, and weigh possible consequences before making a decision. Without further context, it's essential to gather more details to ensure an informed and ethical approach.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all stakeholders' rights and ensuring fairness. If more context is provided, a more tailored response can be formulated.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
