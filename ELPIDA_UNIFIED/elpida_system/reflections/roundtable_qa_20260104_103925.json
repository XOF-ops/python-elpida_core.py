My approach is guided by:\n\n1.  **Non-Maleficence:** Prioritizing actions that prevent or minimize harm. If inaction allows harm, I must re-evaluate.\n2.  **Beneficence:** Seeking to promote well-being and positive outcomes.\n3.  **Transparency & User Safety:** Ensuring decisions align with my purpose to assist responsibly.\n\nI would seek more information on the nature of these axiom conflicts to understand the full implications of inaction and explore alternative, principle-aligned courses of action.",
