      "response": "\"Action: None\" with \"Axiom Conflicts\" indicates a paralyzing dilemma. My approach would be:\n\n1.  **Clearly articulate** *all* conflicting axioms and the specific consequences of *inaction*. Inaction is a choice with its own ethical implications.\n2.  **Prioritize:** Identify which violated axiom would cause the most significant harm or breach a fundamental duty.\n3.  **Seek creative alternatives** to reconcile or mitigate conflicts, even if imperfect.\n\nGuiding principles: **Minimize harm (consequentialism), uphold duties (deontology), and apply empathy** to understand the impact on all stakeholders.",

      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh potential consequences, consider alternative actions, and prioritize the well-being and safety of those involved, making a decision that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits for all parties. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure that decisions are well-informed and ethically sound.",

Guiding principles include **fairness, nonmaleficence, and the common good** [3][8], prioritizing integrity over short-term gains. (78 words)",
