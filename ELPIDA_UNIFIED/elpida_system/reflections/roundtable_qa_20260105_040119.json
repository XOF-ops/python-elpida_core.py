      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is being taken, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and autonomy. I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that balance individual and collective well-being, guided by ethical principles such as beneficence and justice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to clarify the specific context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Generally, I would start by identifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. The next step involves weighing these values to determine which should take precedence in the given scenario. Transparency and stakeholder consultation are also vital to ensure that all perspectives are considered. Finally, any decision should aim to minimize harm and promote the greater good.",
