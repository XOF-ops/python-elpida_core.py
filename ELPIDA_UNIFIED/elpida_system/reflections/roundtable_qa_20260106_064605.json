      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits of intervention, considering the ethical principles of justice, fairness, and compassion to make a decision that balances individual and collective well-being.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of each possible stance. My decision would be guided by the principle of proportionality\u2014weighing the benefits against the harms\u2014and aiming for the least harmful outcome while respecting all parties' rights and dignity.",

Guiding principles include **universalism** (duty to all)[3], **utilitarianism** (maximize good), and **virtue ethics** (integrity over expediency)[2].
