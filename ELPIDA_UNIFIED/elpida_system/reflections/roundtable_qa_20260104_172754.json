      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma, I would first clarify the specific ethical issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), I would assess the potential impacts of inaction. Transparency and communication with affected parties are crucial. If inaction risks significant harm, proactive steps should be considered. However, if the situation is ambiguous, further information and consultation with ethical advisors or stakeholders can help navigate the decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where she has to decide whether to take action or remain passive, but the specific details of the dilemma are not provided. However, when faced with ethical dilemmas, a common guiding principle is the principle of beneficence, which emphasizes doing good and promoting the well-being of others. This principle often involves weighing the potential benefits of an action against the potential harms. \n\nAnother relevant concept is deontology, which focuses on the duties and rights of individuals. This perspective suggests that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. \n\nElpida might consider the potential consequences of her inaction and whether it could lead to harm or negatively impact someone. Balancing the potential benefits and harms and considering the rights and duties involved could help guide her decision-making process.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (68 words)",
