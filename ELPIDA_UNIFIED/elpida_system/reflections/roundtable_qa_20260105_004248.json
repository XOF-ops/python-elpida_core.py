      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and autonomy, weighing the potential consequences of inaction. I'd also consider the axiom conflicts, analyzing how they impact the decision and prioritizing the most important ethical principles to guide my choice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida where no specific action is indicated, I would first clarify the context and identify the conflicting axioms or values at stake. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties involved. If further details emerge, they will refine the approach.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and well-being while fostering transparency and consultation[3][4]. (68 words)",
