    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this by identifying the axiom conflicts and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where no specific action is outlined and axiom conflicts are present, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while ensuring fair treatment of all parties. Transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are also crucial.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where she has to decide whether to take action or remain passive, but the specific details of the dilemma are not provided. However, when faced with ethical dilemmas, a common guiding principle is the principle of beneficence, which emphasizes doing good and promoting the well-being of others. This principle encourages actions that maximize benefits and minimize potential harms. \n\nAnother relevant concept is deontology, which focuses on an individual's duty and the inherent morality of the action itself, regardless of consequences. Elpida might consider the rights and respect of all involved parties and whether her actions adhere to universal ethical standards. \n\nWithout more context, it's challenging to provide a definitive solution, but these principles could serve as a foundation for ethical decision-making.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**[1][2], gather unbiased facts[1][7], apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**[3], evaluate alternatives and consequences[2][3], then select and implement the most ethical option with transparency[3][7]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains.[3][4] (78 words)",
