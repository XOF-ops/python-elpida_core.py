      "response": "Approaching \"Action: None\" with \"Axiom Conflicts\" demands immediate re-evaluation. My core principle would be **Proactive Engagement**: Inaction is a choice that often leads to unacceptable outcomes when fundamental values are violated.\n\nI would identify the specific axioms in conflict and apply the **Principle of Least Harm/Maximizing Good**. The goal is to devise an action that resolves the conflict, minimizes negative consequences, and upholds ethical responsibilities, rather than allowing inaction to cause further harm or injustice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most ethical choice, but it is important to understand the context and underlying principles to make an informed decision. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the avoidance of causing harm. By not taking action, Elpida might be ensuring that no immediate harm is inflicted on anyone. This is especially relevant if the action required could potentially cause more harm than good. \n\nAnother consideration is the principle of justice. Elpida might need to evaluate if taking no action would result in a fair outcome for all involved parties, ensuring that no one is unfairly disadvantaged. \n\nElpida's decision should be based on a thorough understanding of the situation and the potential consequences of her actions or lack thereof.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts**[1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology[2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option[1][6]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term good** while fostering open dialogue[4][7]. (78 words)",
