      "response": "To approach Elpida's dilemma, the specific \"Axiom Conflicts\" must first be identified.\n\nIf \"Action: None\" creates these conflicts, I would:\n1.  **Identify the conflicting axioms:** Understand precisely what values, duties, or principles are being violated or compromised by inaction.\n2.  **Assess consequences:** Evaluate the ethical implications, harms, and benefits of \"Action: None\" versus potential alternative actions.\n3.  **Prioritize:** Apply principles like minimizing harm, maximizing well-being, upholding justice, or fulfilling core duties.\n\nThe decision would be guided by a framework that seeks the greatest good or the least harm, even if it means addressing a difficult conflict head-on rather than letting inaction dictate the outcome.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action itself becomes the crux of the ethical dilemma. The principle of non-maleficence, which is the ethical tenet to \"do no harm,\" could be a guiding factor here. Sometimes, taking no action is the most ethical choice if the available alternatives could potentially cause more harm than good. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider the context and the potential consequences of inaction. In some cases, not acting might lead to missed opportunities to prevent harm or promote positive change. The principle of beneficence, which encourages actions that promote the well-being of others, might also be relevant. \n\nA balanced approach could involve carefully assessing the situation, considering the potential outcomes of various actions, and making a decision that minimizes harm and maximizes overall benefit, even if it involves a degree of calculated risk.",
