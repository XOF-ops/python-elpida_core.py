      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it's to take no action.",

      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida, I would first clarify the specific axiom conflicts involved. My approach would be guided by the principles of transparency, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (act in the best interest of all stakeholders). I would seek to understand the perspectives of all parties affected and consider the long-term consequences of potential actions. If no action is an option, I would ensure that inaction does not lead to harm and aligns with ethical standards.",
