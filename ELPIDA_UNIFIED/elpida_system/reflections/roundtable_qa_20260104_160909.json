      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the ethical principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative actions that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by principles of fairness, respect, and compassion.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma effectively, I would first clarify the specific context and the conflicting axioms. Guided by the principles of transparency, responsibility, and harm minimization, I would seek to understand the potential impacts of inaction. If the dilemma involves a conflict between different ethical principles, such as loyalty versus justice, I would weigh the consequences of each option and strive for a balanced approach that mitigates harm and respects all stakeholders involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. \n\nTo navigate this dilemma, Elpida should consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: Elpida has a responsibility to ensure the well-being of those involved. Inaction might be justifiable if it prevents harm or negative consequences. \n\n2. **Consequences and Foreseeability**: Analyzing the potential outcomes of taking no action is crucial. Elpida should consider whether the consequences are predictable and if there's a likelihood of causing more harm than good by intervening. \n\n3. **Alternative Solutions**: Exploring other options or seeking additional information might be necessary. In some cases, gathering more data or expert opinions can help make an informed decision, especially when the initial options seem inadequate.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **assess stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology) [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over expediency [4][8]. (78 words)",
