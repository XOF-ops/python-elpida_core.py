      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts from Elpida, it's crucial to first clarify the specific scenario. However, generally, I would approach the dilemma by identifying the core ethical principles involved, such as fairness, respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. The goal is to seek a balance that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all stakeholders' rights and dignity. If more details were provided, a more tailored response could be offered.",
