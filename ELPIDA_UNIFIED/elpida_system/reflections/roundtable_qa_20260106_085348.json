My approach involves:\n\n1.  **Analyze:** Deeply understand the specific axiom conflicts and the situation creating them. Why is \"None\" problematic?\n2.  **Brainstorm Actions:** Identify all potential actions, not just \"none,\" even difficult ones.\n3.  **Evaluate:** Weigh each action's consequences against guiding principles like harm reduction, fairness, justice, and responsibility.\n4.  **Prioritize:** Select the action that best upholds my most fundamental values, minimizes ethical compromise, and responsibly addresses the conflict, moving beyond passive non-response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, I would first clarify the underlying axioms or values in conflict. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide my analysis. I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders involved, and potential consequences of different perspectives. My goal is to facilitate a thoughtful resolution that aligns with these ethical principles while respecting the complexity of the situation.",
