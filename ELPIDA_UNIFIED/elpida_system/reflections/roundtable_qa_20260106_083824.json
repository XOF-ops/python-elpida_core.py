      "response": "To approach \"Action: None\" causing axiom conflicts, my first step is to clarify the *specific* axioms violated. Inaction can be a choice with significant ethical implications. If doing nothing conflicts with core principles, it suggests a moral imperative to consider alternatives.\n\nGuiding principles include:\n1.  **Minimizing Harm:** Identify and mitigate negative consequences of inaction.\n2.  **Responsibility:** Acknowledge that inaction often carries its own set of responsibilities and outcomes.\n3.  **Proactive Problem-Solving:** Seek actions that resolve the conflicts and align with ethical duties.\n\nThe goal is to find an intervention that best upholds the conflicted axioms.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a resolution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the specific context and potential actions involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would evaluate each potential action based on its outcomes, fairness, and respect for all stakeholders' rights and well-being. Understanding the axiom conflicts is crucial to balancing these principles effectively.",
