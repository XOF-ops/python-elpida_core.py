      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms from Elpida, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equity), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered.",
