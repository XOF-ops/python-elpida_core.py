      "success": true,
      "response": "My approach would be to first **explicitly identify and articulate each conflicting \"axiom\"** and the precise negative consequences of \"Action: None.\"\n\nNext, I would **explore and evaluate alternative actions**, assessing how each option resolves the identified conflicts, upholds core values, and minimizes harm.\n\nPrinciples guiding this include:\n*   **Prioritizing critical axioms:** Which axioms are paramount?\n*   **Consequentialism:** What action yields the best outcome?\n*   **Deontology:** What duties are violated by inaction?\n\nThe goal is to find an *active* solution that aligns with the most crucial principles, rather than passively allowing axiom conflicts to persist.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at conflict. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the ethics of inaction and potential consequences. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individual choices). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or inaction, in this situation.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. When considering ethical decision-making, especially in cases of inaction, it is crucial to evaluate the potential consequences and the principles at stake. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the duty to do no harm. By not taking action, Elpida might aim to prevent any potential negative consequences. However, this should be balanced with the principle of beneficence, which encourages actions that promote the well-being of others. Elpida should consider if inaction could potentially lead to harm or if it might deprive someone of a beneficial outcome. A comprehensive understanding of the situation and the potential outcomes is necessary to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: identify the issue and gather unbiased facts[1][2], assess stakeholders, values, and principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**[3], evaluate alternatives' consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)[2][3], then select, implement, and review the most ethical option[1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term good over short-term gains[4]. (78 words)",
