      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the core conflict and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical implications of each option to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, I would start by clarifying the core values and principles at stake. Identifying the primary ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics) can help in understanding the nature of the conflict. Next, I would seek to gather more information and perspectives to ensure a well-rounded view. Finally, I would aim for a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes the alignment with the most fundamental values involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially lead to a conflict with her personal values or ethical principles. Without more context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive solution, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Identify the Values at Stake:** Elpida should first recognize the specific ethical principles or values that are in tension. Understanding the nature of the conflict is essential for making an informed decision. \n\n**Consider the Consequences:** Evaluate the potential outcomes of taking or not taking action. Sometimes, ethical decisions require balancing the benefits and harms to various parties involved. \n\n**Apply Ethical Theories:** Utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics could provide a framework for decision-making. For instance, a utilitarian approach would focus on maximizing overall happiness, while a deontological perspective might prioritize duty and inherent rights.",
