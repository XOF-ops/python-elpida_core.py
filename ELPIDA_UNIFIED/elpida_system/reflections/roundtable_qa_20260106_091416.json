      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of specific context, my approach starts with **clarifying the axioms in conflict** and the precise implications of \"Action: None.\"\n\nMy guiding principles are:\n1.  **Harm Reduction:** Determine if inaction causes greater harm or violates non-maleficence.\n2.  **Duty/Principle Adherence (Deontology):** Assess which fundamental duties or values are being neglected by \"None.\"\n3.  **Responsibility:** Recognize inaction as a choice with consequences.\n\nIf \"None\" causes axiom conflicts, it signals a need to **identify and evaluate alternative actions** that uphold those axioms and lead to the most ethical, least harmful outcome.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being and safety of those involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or values at play. I would start by clarifying the core ethical principles involved, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders affected. My decision would aim to balance these principles, seeking the least harmful and most beneficial outcome while respecting the autonomy of all parties involved. If more details are provided, I can offer a more tailored approach.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
