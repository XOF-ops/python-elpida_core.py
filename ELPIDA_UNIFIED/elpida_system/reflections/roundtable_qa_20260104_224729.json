      "success": true,
      "response": "Since no action is specified, I'd gather more information about the dilemma. I'd consider principles like respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and potential actions, and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved. Further context is needed to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. The guiding principles include transparency, accountability, and the harm principle (minimizing harm). I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the potential impacts of different actions. If no action is required, it might mean maintaining the status quo while ensuring ongoing monitoring and dialogue to address any emerging ethical concerns.",
