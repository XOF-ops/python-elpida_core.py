      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd identify the conflicting principles and weigh their importance. I'd consider the context, potential consequences, and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd strive to find a balance that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved. Further information would be necessary to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, I focus on the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices). The key is to analyze the potential impacts of inaction, ensuring that it does not lead to harm and aligns with the values and rights of those involved. Transparency and communication are also crucial to ensure all stakeholders understand the reasoning behind the decision.",

      "response": "I would approach the ELPIDA ethical dilemma systematically: **Identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate alternatives using principles like **nonmaleficence** (avoid harm), **justice** (fairness), and **beneficence** (promote well-being), assess consequences, then select and monitor the best option[1][2][3]. Guiding principles include autonomy, utilitarianism for greatest good, and deontology for duties, prioritizing transparency and consultation[3][4][7]. (78 words)",
