      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the core conflict and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the moral and ethical implications of each option to make a decision that promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the potential impacts and values at stake. From there, a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and fairness would be ideal. Further details on the specific context would help refine this approach.",

Guiding principles include **nonmaleficence** (avoid harm), **justice** (fairness), and **utilitarianism** (greatest good), prioritizing integrity over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
