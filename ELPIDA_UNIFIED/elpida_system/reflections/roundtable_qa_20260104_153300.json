      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the axiomatic conflicts and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and balance competing values to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. The guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders, assess the potential consequences of different actions, and strive for a resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while upholding fairness and integrity. If more details are provided, I can offer a more specific approach.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision, especially if she strongly believes in the importance of both axioms. \n\nOne approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Elpida might weigh the short-term and long-term effects of not intervening. For instance, if her silence could potentially prevent immediate harm or resolve a conflict, it might be justified. However, if inaction could lead to further issues or perpetuate an unjust situation, Elpida may consider speaking up. \n\nThe principle of causing no harm and respecting the rights and dignity of others could be guiding factors in her decision. Elpida's choice should aim to minimize any potential negative impact and ensure that her actions (or lack thereof) do not violate anyone's rights.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, assess stakeholders and competing values, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology), select the best option, implement transparently, and review outcomes.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles: fairness, harm avoidance, well-being promotion, and respect for rights, prioritizing long-term integrity over short-term gains.[3][4]",
