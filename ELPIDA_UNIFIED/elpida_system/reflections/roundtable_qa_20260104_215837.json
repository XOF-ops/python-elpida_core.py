      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the moral implications of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

My approach would be guided by the principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for all stakeholders.

If more specific details were provided, I could offer a more tailored response.",
