      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no specific details are provided, I would consider general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking action, guiding my decision with empathy and a commitment to doing what is right.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. I would seek to understand the context, identify all stakeholders, and consider the potential consequences of each possible action. The goal is to find a balanced solution that respects all values while minimizing harm.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
