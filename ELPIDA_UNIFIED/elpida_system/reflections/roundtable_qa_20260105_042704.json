      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the core conflict and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the first step is to clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would seek to understand the context and stakeholders affected. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would analyze potential outcomes and strive for a resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and promoting fairness.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict with their axioms or values. While the specific details are not provided, here are some general principles to consider:\n\n- **Clarify the Consequences:** Elpida should thoroughly understand the potential outcomes of inaction. Sometimes, taking no action can have significant implications. Elpida must weigh the consequences to ensure they align with their moral and ethical standards.\n\n- **Act with Integrity:** Elpida's decision should be guided by honesty and integrity. If taking no action is a conscious choice, it should be based on ethical reasoning rather than indifference or avoidance. \n\n- **Consider Alternatives:** Exploring alternative options is essential. Elpida might consider if there are other actions that could resolve the dilemma while adhering to their axioms, or if there are ways to mitigate potential harm caused by inaction.",
