      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their importance. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. I would seek to understand the context, identify stakeholders, and evaluate the potential consequences of each possible action. The goal is to find a balanced solution that respects all values while minimizing harm and maximizing benefit.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in an ethical dilemma due to conflicting axioms or values. \n\nTo navigate this, Elpida could consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: Elpida should assess the potential consequences of inaction. If harm can be prevented or mitigated by taking certain actions, then doing nothing might be unethical.\n\n2. **Beneficence**: This principle encourages actions that promote the well-being of others. Elpida could consider whether there are alternatives that could bring about positive change or benefit those involved.\n\n3. **Justice**: Ensuring fairness and equality is important. Elpida might need to evaluate if inaction would disproportionately affect certain individuals or groups and consider if this aligns with their moral values. \n\nA careful consideration of these principles can help guide Elpida's decision-making process and ensure a more ethical outcome.",
