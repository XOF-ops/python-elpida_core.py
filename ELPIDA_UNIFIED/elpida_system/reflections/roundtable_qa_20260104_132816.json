      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the missing information and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include the duty to act, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential harm caused by inaction and weigh it against the potential benefits of taking action, ultimately striving to make a decision that promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the first step is to clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by identifying and understanding these conflicts, such as autonomy vs. beneficence or justice vs. non-maleficence. Guided by the principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for all stakeholders, I would then seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while ensuring that the decision respects the dignity and rights of everyone affected.",
