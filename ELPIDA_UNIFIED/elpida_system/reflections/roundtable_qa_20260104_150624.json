      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the implications of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect for individuals' decisions). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the key is to clarify the underlying principles and values at stake. I would start by identifying the conflicting axioms or ethical principles involved, such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Next, I would gather all relevant information and consider the potential consequences of different inactions. Finally, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, guided by transparency and accountability.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and integrity over expediency.[3][4] (78 words)",
