      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the context and stakeholders involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting principles. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while ensuring fairness and respecting all stakeholders' rights and choices. Further context is needed to provide a more tailored response.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in an ethical dilemma, as indicated by the axiom conflicts. However, without more context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive solution. \n\nWhen faced with such dilemmas, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the underlying ethical principles at play. One guiding principle could be the duty to act with care and responsibility. In some cases, doing nothing might cause harm or perpetuate an unjust situation. Therefore, Elpida should carefully assess the circumstances and consider if there is an obligation to intervene or take preventive measures. Transparency and ethical decision-making processes can help navigate these situations, ensuring that the chosen path aligns with moral values and minimizes potential harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and gather unbiased facts**[1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology[2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option[1][6]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains.[4][3] (78 words)",
