    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, it's crucial to first clarify the underlying issues and potential axiomatic conflicts. Guiding principles include transparency, accountability, and the harm principle. I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives, assess the potential impacts of inaction, and explore alternative actions that align with ethical standards. If no action is necessary, ensuring that this decision does not lead to harm or injustice is paramount.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in an ethical dilemma due to conflicting axioms or values. When faced with such a decision, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the underlying principles at play. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the duty to do no harm. By not acting, Elpida might avoid causing direct harm, but they should also consider potential indirect harm or long-term consequences. Another relevant principle is justice or fairness, which suggests that individuals should be treated equally and without prejudice. Elpida's decision should aim to uphold this principle and ensure that their inaction doesn't lead to an unjust outcome for anyone involved. \n\nA thorough evaluation of the situation and a consideration of alternative options might help Elpida make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence) [3][4], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term good** while fostering open dialogue [1][6]. (78 words)",
