      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach this dilemma by identifying and weighing the conflicting principles. I'd consider the context, potential consequences, and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). A thorough analysis would help resolve the conflict and inform a decision that balances competing ethical considerations.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action presented, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders, and potential impacts. This involves gathering more information, considering all perspectives, and exploring possible actions that align with these ethical principles. If you can provide more details, I can offer a more tailored response.",
