    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the axioms in conflict. Since no action is specified, I consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, considering the potential impact on all parties involved. Further information is needed to make a definitive decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties involved. Dialogue and transparency are crucial in finding a mutually acceptable resolution.",
