      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical implications and potential long-term effects to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is indicated and there are conflicting axioms, the key is to seek a balance that respects all involved parties. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness and equality). The approach involves careful consideration of the context, consulting stakeholders, and exploring all possible outcomes to make a decision that aligns with these ethical principles while minimizing harm.",
