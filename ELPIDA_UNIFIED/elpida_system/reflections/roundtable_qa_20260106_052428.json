      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action presented, it's crucial to identify the underlying values and principles at stake. I would start by clarifying the conflicting axioms or ethical principles involved, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders affected. My decision would be guided by the principle of seeking the greatest good while minimizing harm, ensuring transparency, and respecting the autonomy of all parties involved.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term good over short-term gains.[4][5] (78 words)",
