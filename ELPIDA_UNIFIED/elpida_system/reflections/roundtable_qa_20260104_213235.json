      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. The guiding principles include respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders, assess the potential outcomes, and strive for a solution that minimizes harm while promoting the greatest good. If the dilemma remains unresolved, I would consult ethical frameworks and seek input from ethicists or relevant authorities.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida seems to be facing a situation where there might be a conflict between different ethical principles or values, but the specific details are not provided. When faced with an ethical dilemma, it's important to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Ethical Principles**: Determine the values at stake, such as honesty, fairness, respect for autonomy, or justice.\n\n2. **Analyze the Consequences**: Consider the potential outcomes and impacts of each possible action on all affected parties.\n\n3. **Apply Ethical Theories**: Utilitarianism (maximizing overall happiness), deontology (duty-based ethics), or virtue ethics (focusing on moral character) can provide different perspectives.\n\n4. **Seek Additional Information**: Making an informed decision often requires gathering more facts and understanding the context to avoid unintended consequences.\n\n5. **Consult and Discuss**: Engaging in dialogue with colleagues, mentors, or ethics experts can provide valuable insights and different viewpoints.",

Without knowing the specific situation, stakeholders, and competing values involved, I cannot provide targeted guidance.\n\nTo help you, please describe:\n- **The situation**: What decision or action is at stake?\n- **The conflict**: Which values or principles are clashing?\n- **The stakeholders**: Who is affected?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can apply established ethical frameworks\u2014such as **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**[3]\u2014to guide your decision-making process systematically.",
