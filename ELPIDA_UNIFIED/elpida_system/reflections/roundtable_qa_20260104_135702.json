      "success": true,
      "response": "In the absence of specific details, I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh potential consequences, consider multiple perspectives, and strive for a fair and just resolution, prioritizing the well-being and dignity of all parties affected. Further information would be necessary to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the first step is to clarify the underlying issues and potential conflicts. Guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness, I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the broader implications of inaction. This approach ensures that any decision respects ethical standards and promotes trust and integrity. If more context is provided, a more detailed analysis can be offered.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate competing values (e.g., honesty vs. fairness), assess consequences using frameworks like utilitarianism or justice, and consult others for perspectives[1][2][7]. Guiding principles include **autonomy, justice, common good**, and professional integrity, prioritizing long-term harm reduction and fairness[3][6]. This ensures reasoned, defensible choices[4][9].
