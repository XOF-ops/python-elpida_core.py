      "response": "Without the specifics of ELPIDA's context or the conflicting axioms, a precise solution is impossible.\n\nMy approach would prioritize **understanding the nature and severity of each axiom conflict** and the **consequences of \"Action: None.\"** Guiding principles include:\n\n1.  **Harm Reduction:** Evaluate if \"Action: None\" minimizes overall harm compared to other options.\n2.  **Prioritization:** Determine if one axiom holds greater moral weight or urgency.\n3.  **Transparency:** Ensure the rationale for inaction is justifiable and defensible.\n4.  **Stakeholder Analysis:** Consider who is impacted by inaction.\n\nThe goal is to navigate conflicts responsibly, even if \"no action\" is the chosen path, by ensuring it aligns with the most fundamental ethical duties.",
