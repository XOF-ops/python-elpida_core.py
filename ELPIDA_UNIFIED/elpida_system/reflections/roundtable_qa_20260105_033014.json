      "success": true,
      "response": "Since no specific dilemma is provided from ELPIDA, I'll outline a general approach. I would identify the key stakeholders, their interests, and the potential consequences of each action. Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice. I would weigh these principles against each other to determine the most ethical course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting the rights and choices of all parties. Dialogue and transparency are crucial in navigating such complexities.",
