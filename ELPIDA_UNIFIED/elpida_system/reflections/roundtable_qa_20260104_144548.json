      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles against the situation, considering the potential impact of inaction on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action presented and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. I would then consider a framework like utilitarianism (maximizing overall good), deontology (adhering to moral rules), or virtue ethics (focusing on character and intentions). The goal is to find a balanced solution that respects all stakeholders and aligns with the highest ethical standards.",

Without knowing the actual ethical dilemma you're facing, I can't offer tailored guidance.\n\nHowever, based on established frameworks, ethical decision-making typically involves:\n\n- **Identifying** the core ethical issue and competing values\n- **Gathering** complete, unbiased facts\n- **Considering** all stakeholders and consequences\n- **Applying** ethical principles (justice, autonomy, common good)\n- **Consulting** others for diverse perspectives\n- **Choosing** the option most aligned with your values\n\nCould you share the specific dilemma and axiom conflicts you're wrestling with?",
