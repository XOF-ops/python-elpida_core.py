      "response": "Given \"Action: None\" leads to axiom conflicts, my approach is to:\n\n1.  **Identify the specific axioms violated** and the nature of the harm or inconsistency caused by inaction.\n2.  **Actively seek an intervention** or alternative action that resolves or mitigates these conflicts.\n\nGuiding principles include:\n*   **Responsibility:** We have a duty to prevent harm and uphold ethical standards.\n*   **Deontology:** Adhering to fundamental ethical duties and rules (the axioms).\n*   **Consequentialism:** Prioritizing actions that lead to the best possible outcomes and prevent negative consequences.\n\nInaction is a choice; ethical agency demands we find solutions.",

      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially cause a conflict with certain ethical principles. However, without more context, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive solution. \n\nWhen faced with ethical dilemmas, it is essential to consider the principles of honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Elpida should evaluate the consequences of her actions and inactions and reflect on the potential impact on those involved. She might want to consider seeking additional information to clarify the situation and identify the underlying ethical principles at stake. \n\nMaking an informed decision that aligns with her moral values and minimizes harm to others is crucial. Elpida should also be open to reevaluating her choices if new information arises, demonstrating a commitment to ethical conduct.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, map stakeholders and motivations, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, evaluate alternatives via frameworks (utilitarianism, deontology), assess consequences, select the optimal solution, implement transparently, and review outcomes.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles: **Fairness, harm avoidance, well-being promotion**, and respect for rights, prioritizing long-term integrity over short-term gains.[3][4]",
