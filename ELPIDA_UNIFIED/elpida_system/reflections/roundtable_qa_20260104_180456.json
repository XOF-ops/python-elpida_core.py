      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach this dilemma by gathering context and clarifying the situation. I'd consider principles like non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy, and justice to guide my decision. Without specific details, I'd prioritize caution and seek more information to ensure an informed and ethical choice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I'd start by clarifying the situation and identifying the conflicting axioms or values. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness). I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives, consider the potential consequences of different actions, and aim for a resolution that minimizes harm while promoting the greatest good. If needed, consulting ethics experts or frameworks could provide additional guidance.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance on navigating ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can be just as significant a decision as taking action. Elpida should carefully evaluate the possible outcomes and consider the principles at stake. These might include honesty, fairness, respect for autonomy, or preventing harm. \n\nA thoughtful approach involves weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option, seeking additional information if needed, and considering the short-term and long-term implications. Making a decision based on a thorough understanding of the situation and a clear set of ethical guidelines can help ensure the choice aligns with one's values.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence) [3][4], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** [1][7], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [3]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains [2][5]. This ensures transparency and integrity. (78 words)",
