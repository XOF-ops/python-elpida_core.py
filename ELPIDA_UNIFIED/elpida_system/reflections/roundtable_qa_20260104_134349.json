      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the axioms in conflict and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and the moral obligations involved, striving to find a balance that respects the conflicting axioms and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness in treatment), I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm while promoting the greatest good, respecting individual rights, and ensuring fairness.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision. The absence of action can sometimes be as powerful as any other choice. \n\nElpida's decision should be guided by the principles of non-maleficence and justice. Non-maleficence means doing no harm, and in this case, Elpida might consider whether her intervention could potentially cause more harm than good. Justice relates to fairness and equality, and she should reflect on whether her actions might unfairly impact one group over another. \n\nElpida's approach could involve gathering more information to understand the underlying causes of the issue. Sometimes, the most ethical decision is to refrain from acting impulsively and instead focus on long-term solutions that address the root causes, ensuring a more sustainable and ethical outcome.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts**[1][2], **assess stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3][4], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology[2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option[1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
