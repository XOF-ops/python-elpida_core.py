      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core issue and key stakeholders. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the moral implications of each possible course of action, seeking a solution that balances individual and collective well-being.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to consider the guiding principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness). Without specific actions or contexts, the focus should be on fostering an environment where these principles are upheld, ensuring that any future decisions are made with a clear ethical framework in mind. This approach helps in maintaining integrity and trust.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being while fostering transparency.[65 words]",
