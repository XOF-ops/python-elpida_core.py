      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include the duty to act when harm or injustice is present, respect for autonomy, and non-maleficence (do no harm). Since no action is specified, I would gather more information to determine the most ethical course of action, weighing potential benefits and harms to all parties involved.",

Guided by principles of transparency, non-maleficence, and respect for autonomy, I would aim to identify all stakeholders and their interests. The next step would be to evaluate potential actions based on their alignment with these principles, aiming to minimize harm and promote fairness and justice. If further guidance is needed, please provide more details about the dilemma.",

Guiding principles include **fairness**, **honesty**, **respect for autonomy**, and maximizing overall good while minimizing harm[2][3]. (78 words)",
