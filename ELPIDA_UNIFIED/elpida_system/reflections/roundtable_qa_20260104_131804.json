    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative actions that balance competing values and minimize harm. Ultimately, I'd strive to make a decision that promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the key is to balance the principles involved. I would start by identifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of each value being prioritized. My goal would be to find a resolution that minimizes harm and respects all parties involved, guided by the principle of proportionality and the greater good.",
