      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and autonomy, guiding my decision to avoid causing harm and respecting the rights of those involved. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specified action and axiom conflicts, it's crucial to first clarify the specific context and conflicting principles involved. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits while respecting all parties' rights and fairness. Open dialogue and transparency are also vital in navigating such dilemmas.",

Guiding principles include **utilitarianism** (greatest good)[3], **deontology** (duties)[2], and transparency, monitored post-decision[1][3]. (78 words)",
