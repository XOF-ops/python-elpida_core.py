      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking a stance, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, I focus on the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices). Without clear actions or conflicts, the key is to maintain awareness of these principles and ensure that any future decisions align with them. This approach helps in preemptively avoiding potential ethical issues.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** for all involved[4][3]. Select, implement, and review the most ethical option transparently[1][3]. (78 words)",
