      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by clarifying the context and identifying the conflicting axioms. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh potential consequences and prioritize the well-being of all parties involved, seeking a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered. The goal is to find a resolution that respects all axioms as much as possible, or at least justifies prioritizing one over another based on the context.",
