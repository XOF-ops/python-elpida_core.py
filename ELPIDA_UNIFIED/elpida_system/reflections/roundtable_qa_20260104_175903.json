    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their importance. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd also consider the moral implications of inaction and potential long-term effects on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Engaging stakeholders in dialogue can also provide insights and lead to a more informed and ethically sound resolution.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action is the primary concern, suggesting a need for proactive decision-making. The principle of responsibility dictates that one should take ownership of their choices and their consequences. Inaction can sometimes cause harm, especially if there is an obligation to act or intervene. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it might be beneficial to consider the potential consequences of remaining passive. Could this inaction lead to harm or perpetuate an unjust situation? Ethical principles like beneficence (promoting good) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm) can guide decision-making. Taking initiative, even if it involves difficult choices, is often necessary to uphold these principles and ensure the best possible outcome for all involved.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions [7]. (78 words)",
