      "response": "Given \"Action: None\" leads to \"Axiom Conflicts,\" inaction is not an ethical option. My approach would be to immediately identify the specific axioms violated and proactively explore alternative actions to resolve or mitigate these conflicts, ensuring alignment with foundational principles.\n\nGuiding principles are:\n1.  **Duty to Uphold Axioms:** Fundamental principles require active defense.\n2.  **Ethical Responsibility:** The imperative to act when inaction causes conflict.\n3.  **Proactive Problem-Solving:** Seeking solutions that restore ethical integrity.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by clarifying the values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential impacts of each principle. The goal is to find a balanced approach that respects all values while minimizing harm. If the dilemma remains unresolved, seeking input from stakeholders and ethical guidelines can provide additional perspectives.",
