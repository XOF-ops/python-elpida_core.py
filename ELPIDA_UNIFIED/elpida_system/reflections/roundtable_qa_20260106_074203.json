      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the moral implications of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, it's crucial to first clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting principles. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Engaging in dialogue with all stakeholders to understand their perspectives can help in finding a morally coherent solution.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and greatest good** while fostering transparent dialogue [1][5]. (78 words)",
