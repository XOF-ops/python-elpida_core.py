    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the ethical responsibilities involved, striving to make a decision that balances individual rights with the greater good. Further information about the specific dilemma is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specified action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the specific conflict and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Engaging in dialogue with all parties to understand their perspectives is crucial. Transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are also essential to maintain trust and integrity.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision, especially if she strongly believes in the importance of both axioms. \n\nOne approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Elpida might weigh the immediate and long-term outcomes of not intervening. If her inaction could lead to significant harm or perpetuate an unjust situation, she may decide to act, even if it means temporarily compromising one of the axioms. \n\nAnother guiding principle could be the idea of minimizing harm. Elpida could consider which course of action, or inaction, would result in the least harm overall, especially if a quick resolution is not possible. This approach emphasizes the importance of making an informed decision to ensure the best possible outcome, even in a complex ethical dilemma.",
