      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the moral and ethical implications of each option to make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting principles. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders involved, and potential outcomes. From there, a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and ensuring fairness would be pursued.",

Guiding principles include **fairness, respect for others, and prioritizing the vulnerable**.[2][8] (78 words)",
