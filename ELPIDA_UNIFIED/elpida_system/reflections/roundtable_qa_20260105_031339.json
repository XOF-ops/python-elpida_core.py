      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values at stake and considering the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I would prioritize gathering more information to determine the best course of action that respects these principles and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual freedom), and justice (fairness). Without specific actions or contexts, reflecting on these principles helps in preparing a framework for decision-making. If faced with a particular scenario, I would assess how each option aligns with these ethical standards to determine the most responsible course of action.",
