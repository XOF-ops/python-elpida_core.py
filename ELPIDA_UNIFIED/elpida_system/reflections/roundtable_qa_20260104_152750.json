      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In approaching this dilemma, the first step is to clarify the specific ethical conflicts and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), I would seek to understand the potential impacts of inaction. Transparency and communication with all parties are crucial to ensure informed decision-making. If inaction risks significant harm, proactive steps may be necessary. However, without specific details, it\u2019s challenging to provide a concrete action. The goal is to balance ethical obligations and minimize harm.",
