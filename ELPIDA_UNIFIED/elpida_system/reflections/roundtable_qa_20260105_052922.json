    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles against the potential outcomes of inaction to determine the most ethical course.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida, it's crucial to clarify the specific context and the conflicting axioms involved. However, generally, I would start by identifying the core values at stake, such as integrity, harm prevention, and fairness. Next, I would consider the potential outcomes of different actions, aiming to minimize harm and maximize benefit. Transparency and accountability are also vital in ensuring that decisions are justifiable and ethically sound. If the dilemma involves conflicting duties, I would prioritize the well-being of affected parties and seek a balanced solution that respects all involved.",
