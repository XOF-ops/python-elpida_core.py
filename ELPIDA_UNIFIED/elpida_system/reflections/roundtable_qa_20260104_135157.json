      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their importance. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and the moral implications of each axiom, ultimately choosing a course that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I'd start by clarifying the conflicting axioms or principles involved. This helps in understanding the core of the issue. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while considering all stakeholders' perspectives. Transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are also crucial.",

Guiding principles include **fairness, harm avoidance, and greatest good** via frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology[2][3], ensuring transparency and integrity.[6] (78 words)",
