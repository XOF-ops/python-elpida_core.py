      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential benefits and harms of taking no action, prioritizing the well-being and safety of all parties involved, and consider alternative courses of action that may better align with these principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, I would start by clarifying the core values and principles at stake. Identifying the key ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics) can help in evaluating the potential impacts and moral obligations. The goal is to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all involved parties. If further context is provided, a more tailored solution can be developed.",
