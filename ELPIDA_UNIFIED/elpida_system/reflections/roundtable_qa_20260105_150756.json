      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral imperative to act in the best interest of those affected, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is outlined, it's crucial to consider core ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness). Without a specific scenario, the general approach is to assess the potential impacts of any action or inaction on all stakeholders, ensuring that decisions align with these principles. If conflicts arise, prioritizing the least harmful and most beneficial outcomes while respecting individual rights and ensuring fairness is key.",

Guiding principles: **integrity**, **fairness**, and **harm minimization** prioritize long-term good over short-term gains[3][6]. (78 words)",
