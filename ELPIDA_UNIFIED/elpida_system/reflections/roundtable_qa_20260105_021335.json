      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and balance individual rights with the greater good, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision-making process. It's important to weigh these principles, consider the potential outcomes, and seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity. If possible, consulting stakeholders and ethical frameworks can provide additional insights.",
