      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the ethical implications of inaction. Guiding principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good) would influence my decision, prompting me to weigh potential consequences and consider alternative courses of action that align with these principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or values at play. My approach would be guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices). I would also consider the context, stakeholders involved, and potential consequences of inaction. The goal is to find a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action itself seems to be the source of the ethical dilemma, suggesting a potential conflict between the principles of non-maleficence and beneficence. \n\nThe principle of non-maleficence emphasizes the duty to do no harm, which may guide one's decision to refrain from taking action to avoid any potential negative consequences. However, the principle of beneficence requires one to act in a way that promotes the well-being of others, which might prompt intervention to ensure a positive outcome. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, a comprehensive understanding of the situation is essential. Gathering more information, consulting relevant experts, and carefully weighing the potential consequences of action or inaction can help inform a decision that aligns with ethical principles and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **assess stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
