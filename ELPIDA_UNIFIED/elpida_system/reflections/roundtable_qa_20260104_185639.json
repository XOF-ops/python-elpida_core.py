      "success": true,
      "response": "Since there's no action or axiom conflicts provided, I'd approach this by gathering more information about the dilemma. I'd consider principles like respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice to guide my decision, and weigh the potential consequences of different actions.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing the dilemma from Elpida, the first step is to clearly identify the conflicting ethical axioms. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices) are crucial. I would assess the potential impacts of inaction, considering the harm or benefit to all stakeholders. Transparency and seeking input from affected parties can also guide a balanced decision. If inaction is the chosen path, it should be justified by minimizing harm and aligning with ethical principles.",
