      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core issue and relevant stakeholders. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against possible actions, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those involved. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness), I would analyze how these principles apply to the specific situation. The goal is to find a balance that respects all values while minimizing harm and promoting the greater good. Further details would help in providing a more tailored response.",
