      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or inaction, in the given situation.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or values. Guided by principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and potential consequences. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and respects all involved. If you can provide more details about the specific dilemma, I can offer a more tailored response.",
