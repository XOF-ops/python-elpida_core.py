      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is taken, the guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor the rights and decisions of individuals). The first step is to identify the conflicting axioms or values. Then, assess the potential impacts of inaction versus possible actions. Finally, seek a resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all stakeholders' rights and choices.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains [4][6]. (78 words)",
