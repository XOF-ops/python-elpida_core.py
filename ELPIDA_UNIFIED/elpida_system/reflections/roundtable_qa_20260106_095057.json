      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential harm or benefit of alternative actions, considering the ethical principles and values at stake to make a decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of transparency, non-maleficence, and beneficence, I would seek to understand the potential impacts and values at stake. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties' rights and dignity. Further details would help refine this approach.",
