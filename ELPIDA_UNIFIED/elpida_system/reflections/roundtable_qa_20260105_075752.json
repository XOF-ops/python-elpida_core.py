      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is indicated, it's crucial to identify the underlying principles at stake. Guided by the axioms of non-mreatment (avoiding harm), beneficence (promoting good), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (ensuring fairness), I would first clarify the context and stakeholders involved. Then, I would assess which principles are in conflict and seek a balanced resolution that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good, respecting all parties' rights and ensuring fair treatment.",

You've referenced \"ELPIDA\" and mentioned \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but haven't described the actual dilemma itself.\n\nTo properly guide you through ethical decision-making, I need details about:\n\n- **The situation**: What decision or conflict are you facing?\n- **The stakeholders**: Who is affected?\n- **The conflicting values**: What principles are in tension?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can apply established frameworks[1][2][3] to help you systematically identify ethical issues, gather facts, evaluate alternatives, and reach a principled decision.",
