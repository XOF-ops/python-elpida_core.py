      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, considering the potential impact on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or values at play. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual freedom), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. The first step is to clarify the situation, understand all stakeholders' perspectives, and assess the potential impacts of inaction. Balancing these principles helps in formulating a reasoned approach that aims to resolve the conflict ethically.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance. \n\nWhen faced with an ethical dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can be just as significant a decision as taking action. Elpida should carefully evaluate the situation and consider the principles at stake. Some key principles that could guide her decision-making process include the duty of care, justice, and respect for autonomy. Balancing these principles and considering the potential outcomes for all involved parties will help Elpida make an informed and ethical choice. Prioritizing transparency and open communication can also help navigate such dilemmas effectively.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **assess stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][8]. Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over expediency [4][6]. (78 words)",
