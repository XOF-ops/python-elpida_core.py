      "success": true,
      "response": "I would analyze the situation, identifying key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh potential consequences of inaction against possible outcomes of alternative actions, considering the greater good and minimizing harm. Ultimately, a decision would be made based on a nuanced balancing of these ethical principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would start by clarifying the context and identifying the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Key steps include gathering all relevant information, considering the stakeholders affected, and exploring potential consequences of different actions. Guiding principles might include beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where she has to consider the potential consequences of her actions, especially since her choices might impact her relationship with her family. \n\nElpida's decision-making process could be guided by several principles:\n\n1. Respect for Family: Elpida might prioritize maintaining harmony within her family and consider the feelings and opinions of her parents and siblings. \n\n2. Personal Integrity: She could reflect on her own values and beliefs, ensuring that her actions align with her personal code of ethics. \n\n3. Open Communication: Encouraging dialogue and expressing her concerns to her family could help find a solution that respects everyone's boundaries. \n\nElpida's approach should aim to balance her personal beliefs with the potential impact on her family relationships, seeking a resolution that minimizes harm and fosters understanding.",
