      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential impact on all parties involved and consider alternative courses of action to determine the most ethical response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is none and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to first identify the conflicting principles. I would start by clarifying the core values at stake and consider the potential impacts of inaction. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (promote good), I would explore alternative actions that could resolve the conflict or mitigate negative outcomes, ensuring that my response aligns with ethical standards and promotes the greater good.",
