      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical axioms and their conflicts to make a decision that promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or conflicting axioms from Elpida, the first step is to clarify the specific issue and identify the stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek to understand all perspectives and potential consequences. Transparency and communication with all parties are crucial to navigate towards a resolution that upholds integrity and respects all involved.",
