      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). Since \"Action: None\" is stated, I would weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking action, and consider alternative courses of action that align with ethical principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. The guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, beneficence (acting in the best interest of others), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice (fairness). I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders and consider the potential outcomes of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting ethical norms.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially cause a conflict with one of her fundamental principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, the mention of \"none\" as the action might suggest a decision to remain passive or inactive. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Elpida should examine whether her decision to do nothing might violate any ethical or moral obligations she holds. She should reflect on values like responsibility, duty of care, and the potential impact of her actions on others. Making an informed decision requires weighing the potential outcomes and aligning her actions with her core values, ensuring that her inaction does not cause harm or compromise her integrity.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I notice your query references an \"ethical dilemma from ELPIDA\" but doesn't specify what the dilemma is. Without the actual scenario, axiom conflicts, or context, I cannot provide targeted guidance.\n\nHowever, **ethical decision-making generally follows these key steps**: identify the issue, gather facts, consider all stakeholders' perspectives, apply ethical principles (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence), evaluate consequences, and choose the most ethically sound option[1][2][3].\n\nTo help you effectively, please share the specific dilemma, the conflicting values involved, and the stakeholders affected.",
