      "response": "The dilemma isn't an explicit conflict, but the *assertion* that \"Action: None\" presents no axiom conflicts. My approach would be to critically interrogate this assertion.\n\n**Guiding principles:**\n\n1.  **Thoroughness:** Verify that *all* relevant axioms (including long-term consequences, indirect effects, and human-centric values) have been genuinely considered.\n2.  **Proactive Ethics:** Question if \"Action: None\" truly maximizes good or minimizes potential harm, as inaction itself can have significant ethical implications.\n3.  **Contextual Clarity:** Seek a deeper understanding of the situation to ensure no critical factors were overlooked in Elpida's assessment.",

      "response": "I would analyze the situation, identifying key stakeholders and potential consequences. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the first step is to clarify the underlying issues and conflicts. Guided by principles of transparency, responsibility, and fairness, I would seek to understand all perspectives involved. The goal is to foster a dialogue that can lead to a resolution respecting all axioms as much as possible, while prioritizing harm reduction and promoting ethical integrity.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important axioms: \"Do no harm\" and \"Act with integrity and honesty.\" \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of beneficence, which emphasizes promoting the well-being of others. Elpida could consider whether inaction would potentially cause more harm than taking proactive measures. Exploring alternatives to resolve the conflict is essential. For instance, Elpida could seek additional information or consult relevant experts to make an informed decision, ensuring transparency and minimizing potential harm. \n\nAnother consideration is the principle of justice, which entails treating people fairly. Elpida should examine if inaction would inadvertently favor one party over another, potentially leading to an unjust outcome. A balanced approach, considering all affected parties, might be necessary to navigate this ethical dilemma effectively.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (72 words)",
