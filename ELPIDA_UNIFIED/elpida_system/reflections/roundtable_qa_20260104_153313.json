      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles may include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy, and justice. I would weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma effectively, I would first clarify the specific ethical conflicts and context involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), I would assess the potential impacts of inaction. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered. Ultimately, the decision should aim to minimize harm and maximize benefit, aligning with ethical standards and organizational values.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
