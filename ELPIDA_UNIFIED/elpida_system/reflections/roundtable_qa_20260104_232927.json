    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits of intervention, considering the ethical principles and values at stake to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is indicated, the guiding principles are often rooted in transparency, accountability, and the promotion of the greater good. It's crucial to assess the potential impacts of inaction versus action, considering all stakeholders involved. Ethical frameworks like utilitarianism (maximizing overall happiness), deontology (adhering to moral duties), and virtue ethics (focusing on character and intentions) can provide valuable perspectives. In this case, without specific details, reflecting on these principles helps in formulating a considered response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging choice, especially if she strongly believes in the importance of both axioms. Here are some guiding principles to consider:\n\n**Prioritize Values**: Elpida should reflect on the core values she holds. If one axiom represents a fundamental belief, like protecting free speech, she may choose to prioritize it. \n\n**Minimize Harm**: The principle of doing no harm is essential. Elpida could consider the potential consequences of inaction and whether it might inadvertently lead to harm or further complications. \n\n**Seek Alternative Solutions**: Exploring creative solutions is advisable. Perhaps there's a way to address the issue without directly contradicting either axiom, such as finding a compromise or seeking additional guidance from relevant authorities or experts. \n\nElpida's decision should aim to uphold her values while minimizing potential negative outcomes.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence) [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** [7], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][3]. Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions [2][7]. (78 words)",
