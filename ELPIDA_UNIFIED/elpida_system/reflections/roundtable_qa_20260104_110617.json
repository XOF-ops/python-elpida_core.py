    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting principles and evaluating their moral implications. I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it's inaction.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while respecting all stakeholders' rights and promoting the greater good. Dialogue and transparency are crucial in finding a resolution that aligns with these ethical principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially lead to a conflict with her own axioms or principles. While the specific details are not provided, the dilemma seems to revolve around the decision to remain passive or inactive in a situation that might require intervention. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Elpida should examine whether her decision to do nothing might result in harm or an unjust outcome. The principle of causing no harm and promoting fairness could guide her actions. Elpida might also consider if there is a responsibility or duty to act, especially if her intervention could lead to a more positive or just resolution. Balancing the potential outcomes and aligning her actions with her core values and beliefs is crucial.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **assess stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** while fostering open dialogue [4][8]. (78 words)",
