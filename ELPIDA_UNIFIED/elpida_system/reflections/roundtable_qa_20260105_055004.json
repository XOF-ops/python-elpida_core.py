    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there is no action or axiom conflicts provided, I would consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good), to determine the most ethical course of action. Further information would be necessary to make a decision.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. It's essential to weigh these principles, consider the context, and seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Engaging stakeholders in dialogue can also provide valuable insights and help navigate the conflict.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision. Sometimes, doing nothing can be a powerful choice, especially when considering the potential consequences of other actions. \n\nElpida's decision should be guided by the principles of minimizing harm and respecting autonomy. Firstly, she should consider if taking no action would cause more harm than good. If her inaction could prevent potential harm to others or herself, it might be the ethical choice. Secondly, Elpida should respect the autonomy of individuals involved and consider if any action might interfere with their freedom or decision-making. \n\nA thoughtful analysis of the situation, considering potential outcomes and the well-being of all parties, will help Elpida make an informed and ethical decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: identify the issue and stakeholders[1][2], gather unbiased facts[1][8], apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**[3], evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)[2][3], then select and monitor the best option[1][3]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term good while fostering transparency[4][5]. (78 words)",
