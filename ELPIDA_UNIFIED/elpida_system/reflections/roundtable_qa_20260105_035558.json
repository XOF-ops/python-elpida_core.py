    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida where no specific action is indicated but axiom conflicts exist, I would first clarify the conflicting axioms to understand the core ethical issues. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits while ensuring fairness. If more context is provided, a more tailored approach can be outlined.",
