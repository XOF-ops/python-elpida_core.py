      "response": "To approach this, I'd first define the *specific context* of \"Action: None.\" Inaction isn't neutral; it's a choice with consequences.\n\nThe core task is to identify what ethical axioms are *breached by omission*. Principles guiding this include:\n\n*   **Duty/Responsibility:** Am I failing an obligation?\n*   **Non-maleficence:** Is harm occurring that I could prevent?\n*   **Beneficence:** Am I missing an opportunity to do good?\n*   **Justice:** Is an injustice being allowed to persist?\n\nThe dilemma arises when inaction contradicts a moral imperative to act, allowing harm or injustice to continue.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
