      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida, it's crucial to clarify the specific axiom conflicts involved. However, generally, I would approach this by prioritizing principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and respect for autonomy. I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm while promoting the greater good, ensuring all stakeholders' rights and perspectives are considered. If more details are provided, a more tailored response can be offered.",

Your query references \"ELPIDA\" and mentions \"Action: None\" and \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but doesn't describe the specific ethical dilemma itself.\n\nTo apply ethical decision-making frameworks effectively, I need to understand:\n\n- **What is the dilemma?** What decision or situation requires ethical analysis?\n- **Who are the stakeholders?** Which individuals or groups are affected?\n- **What values conflict?** What principles are in tension?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through structured approaches like identifying affected parties, evaluating consequences, and applying ethical principles (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3] to reach a sound decision.",
