      "response": "Given \"None\" resulted in \"Axiom Conflicts,\" my first step is to identify the specific axioms violated and the consequences of inaction. I would then analyze the root cause of the conflict.\n\nPrinciples guiding my decision include:\n1.  **Rectifying harm:** Prioritize actions to mitigate any negative impact caused by the inaction.\n2.  **Upholding foundational principles:** Determine the minimal necessary action to restore alignment with the core axioms.\n3.  **Preventative action:** Implement measures to ensure similar conflicts don't arise from future inaction or oversight.\n\nThis involves active problem-solving to restore ethical coherence.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the axiom conflicts and considering the ethical implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, striving for a decision that promotes the well-being and dignity of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to evaluate the underlying principles at stake. I would start by identifying the core values in conflict, such as harm, justice, or autonomy. The guiding principle here is to do no harm (non-maleficence) while striving for the greatest good (utilitarianism). If inaction prevents further harm and respects all parties' rights, it might be the most ethical choice. However, transparency and communication with all stakeholders are essential to ensure that the decision is understood and justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a challenging situation where taking no action might seem like the easiest option, but it could potentially lead to more significant issues in the future. While the details of the dilemma are not provided, it's clear that there is a conflict between different axioms or values. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, taking no action can be a form of decision-making, especially if it is a conscious choice. Elpida should examine the underlying principles and values at stake and prioritize those that align with ethical standards, fairness, and long-term well-being. Making a decision based on these principles can help guide Elpida towards a resolution that minimizes harm and promotes a sense of responsibility.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the ELPIDA ethical dilemma systematically: **identify the core issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate competing values (e.g., honesty vs. relationships) using frameworks like universalism and justice, assess consequences, and consult others for perspectives.[1][2][3][6]\n\nGuiding principles: **autonomy, justice, common good**, prioritizing fairness, harm minimization, and long-term integrity over short-term gains.[2][3][5] (68 words)",
