      "success": true,
      "response": "This dilemma requires identifying *which specific axioms* are conflicted by \"Action: None.\" This clarifies the ethical imperative: inaction itself is causing harm or violating fundamental principles.\n\n**Principles Guiding Decision:**\n\n1.  **Deontology:** What duty is being neglected by inaction?\n2.  **Consequentialism:** What negative outcomes will arise from \"None\"?\n3.  **Responsibility:** Is there an obligation to intervene or prevent harm?\n\nApproach: Analyze the nature of the axiom conflicts to understand the required duty or the harm to be prevented. Then, explore alternative actions that uphold those axioms and mitigate negative consequences, even if difficult. \"None\" is clearly not an ethical option here.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justifiable.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered.",
