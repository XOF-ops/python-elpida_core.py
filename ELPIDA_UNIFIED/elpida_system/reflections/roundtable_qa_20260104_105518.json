      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justifiable.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would start by clarifying the situation and identifying the conflicting axioms or values. Guided by principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, I would assess the potential impacts of all possible actions. The goal is to find a balance that maximizes good while minimizing harm, respects all parties' rights, and ensures fairness. Further details about the specific context and stakeholders involved would be crucial for a more tailored approach.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains [4][3]. (78 words)",
