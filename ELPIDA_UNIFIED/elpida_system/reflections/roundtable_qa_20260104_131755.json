    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that balance competing values and minimize harm. Ultimately, a decision would be made based on a careful analysis of the ethical principles at stake.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the specific situation and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. My approach would be guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness). I would aim to understand the context, identify stakeholders, and consider the potential consequences of different actions. If further details are provided, I can offer a more tailored response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance on navigating ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the underlying values at stake. Elpida should examine the principles that are in tension and try to find a resolution that minimizes harm and respects all relevant ethical considerations. This may involve seeking additional information, consulting ethical guidelines or experts, and carefully weighing the potential outcomes. Prioritizing transparency, fairness, and the well-being of all involved parties can help guide Elpida toward an ethically justifiable decision.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over short-term gains[3][8]. (78 words)",
