      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to assess the underlying principles at stake. The guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness). If inaction leads to harm, then beneficence and non-maleficence may require intervention. However, if action would violate autonomy or justice, inaction might be justified. The context and potential outcomes of each option must be carefully weighed to make an ethically sound decision.",
