    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I consider the potential consequences of inaction and the ethical obligations to act, balancing individual rights with the greater good.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values and principles at stake. Guided by principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders to understand their perspectives can also provide valuable insights. Ultimately, transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are crucial.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially impact her relationship with her parents and her personal freedom. The dilemma highlights a conflict between two important principles: respect for authority and personal autonomy. \n\nElpida's decision to not take any action is guided by the principle of respect for her parents' authority and their rules. By choosing to not attend the party, she demonstrates obedience and consideration for her parents' wishes, which is an important value in many families and cultures. This decision prioritizes maintaining a harmonious family relationship and honoring the trust and boundaries set by her parents. \n\nHowever, this choice may also involve a sacrifice of personal autonomy, as Elpida is not exercising her freedom to make her own decisions about social engagements.",

Without knowing the specific situation, stakeholders, values, or competing principles involved, I cannot provide targeted guidance.\n\nTo help you, please describe:\n- **The situation**: What decision needs to be made?\n- **The conflict**: Which values or principles are in tension?\n- **The stakeholders**: Who is affected?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can apply established ethical decision-making frameworks to guide your approach.",
