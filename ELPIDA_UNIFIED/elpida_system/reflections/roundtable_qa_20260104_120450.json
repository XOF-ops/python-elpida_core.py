    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and autonomy. I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that respect the rights and dignity of those involved, guiding my decision with empathy and a commitment to fairness.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing the dilemma from Elpida, it's crucial to first identify the conflicting axioms. If the action is \"None,\" it suggests a passive stance, which might conflict with principles of responsibility and intervention. Guiding principles could include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act for the good of others), and respect for autonomy. I would assess the potential harm or benefit of taking action versus inaction, and consider if inaction aligns with ethical standards and values. If inaction is justifiable, it must be thoroughly documented and reviewed.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I appreciate your question, but I need clarification: your prompt references \"ELPIDA\" and \"Axiom Conflicts\" without providing the specific ethical dilemma details. To apply decision-making frameworks effectively, I need to understand:\n\n- **What is the actual ethical dilemma?** (the situation, competing interests, stakeholders involved)\n- **What are the specific axiom conflicts?** (which values or principles are in tension?)\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through a systematic approach using established frameworks like identifying stakeholders, evaluating consequences, applying ethical principles (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence), and weighing alternatives\u2014as outlined in the decision-making models I have access to.\n\nPlease share the dilemma details, and I'll provide targeted guidance.",
