      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. I'd consider principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I'd prioritize gathering more information to inform a decision that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders involved, and potential consequences of inaction. Balancing these principles and ensuring transparency in the reasoning process is crucial.",
