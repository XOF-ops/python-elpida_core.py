      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to consider the guiding principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), justice (fairness and equality), and respect for autonomy (honoring individuals' rights to make their own decisions). Without specific actions or contexts, reflecting on these principles helps in formulating a balanced and ethical response when the situation becomes clearer.",
