      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd assess the situation, identifying key stakeholders and their interests. Guided by principles of respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm), I'd weigh potential consequences of inaction versus action. Considering the axiom conflicts, I'd prioritize transparency, accountability, and the well-being of those affected, striving for a decision that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where no specific action is taken, the guiding principles would be non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and respect for autonomy (honor the rights of individuals to make their own choices). The approach would involve assessing potential harms and benefits, ensuring that inaction does not lead to unintended negative consequences, and considering how inaction aligns with moral obligations and societal norms. Communication and transparency with all stakeholders are crucial to maintain trust and integrity.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict between two important axioms: \"Do no harm\" and \"Promote justice and fairness\". \n\nOne possible approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can inadvertently cause harm, especially if the situation involves ongoing injustice or an escalating conflict. Elpida might consider whether there is an opportunity to intervene in a way that minimizes harm and promotes a peaceful resolution. \n\nAnother guiding principle could be the duty to care and protect. Elpida could explore options to provide support or resources to those affected without directly intervening in the conflict. Taking a neutral stance might be appropriate, but it should not prevent Elpida from offering assistance that could alleviate potential harm.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**, and evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology).[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles: fairness, harm avoidance, well-being promotion, and transparency. Weigh options, consult others, select the most ethical solution, implement, and review outcomes.[1][7][9] (68 words)",
