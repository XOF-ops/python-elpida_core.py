      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts, I would first seek to clarify the specific issues and stakes involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness and equality), I would analyze how different actions align with these values. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties' rights and promoting fairness.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially impact her relationship with her friend and her own personal values. Here are some guiding principles to consider:\n\n1. **Honesty and Trust**: Elpida values her friendship and believes in being truthful. She might consider whether keeping silent would breach her friend's trust in the long run. \n\n2. **Confidentiality**: Respecting her friend's privacy is important, but it should not hinder potential support for her friend's well-being. \n\n3. **Well-being and Support**: Elpida could reflect on the potential consequences of her inaction. Sometimes, offering support and guidance to a friend in need can be crucial for their welfare. \n\nElpida's decision should align with her personal values, prioritizing the preservation of trust and the potential benefit to her friend's situation. It may be beneficial to encourage open communication while ensuring a supportive and non-judgmental environment.",
