      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the axioms in conflict. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of those involved, guiding my decision with empathy and a commitment to minimizing harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma, I would first seek to clarify the specific ethical principles in conflict. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), I would consider the potential consequences of inaction. If inaction leads to harm, I would explore alternative actions that minimize harm while adhering to other ethical principles such as justice and respect for autonomy. Transparency and stakeholder consultation would also be crucial in making an informed and ethical decision.",
