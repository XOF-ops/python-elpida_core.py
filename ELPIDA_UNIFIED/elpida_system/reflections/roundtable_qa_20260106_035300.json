      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying axiom conflicts and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. It's essential to weigh these principles, consider the potential impacts of inaction, and seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and respects all parties involved. If possible, consulting stakeholders and ethical guidelines can provide additional insights.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
