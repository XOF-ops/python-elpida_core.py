      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the axiom conflicts and considering the ethical implications. I'm guided by principles of respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). Since no action is specified, I prioritize gathering more information to understand the context and potential consequences of inaction. This informed approach allows me to weigh the ethical considerations and make a decision that minimizes harm and respects all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to identify the underlying principles and values at stake. I would start by clarifying the specific axiom conflicts involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (treat all parties fairly), I would seek a resolution that minimizes harm, maximizes benefits, and respects the rights and dignity of all affected. Transparency and communication are also vital in ensuring that all stakeholders understand the reasoning behind any decisions made.",
