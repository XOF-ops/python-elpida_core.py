      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is taken, I consider the potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), autonomy, and justice. I weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course, even if it's choosing not to act.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, it's crucial to identify the underlying values and principles at stake. I would start by clarifying the conflicting axioms to understand the core issues. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties involved. Open dialogue and transparency can also help in finding a morally coherent resolution.",
