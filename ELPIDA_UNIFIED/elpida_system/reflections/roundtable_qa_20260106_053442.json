      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders, their interests, and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (promote good). I'd weigh these principles against the potential outcomes of inaction, considering the moral implications and potential harm that could arise from taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all voices are heard and considered.",
