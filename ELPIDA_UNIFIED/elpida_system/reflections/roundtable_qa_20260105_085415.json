My approach involves first identifying and clearly articulating the specific conflicting axioms.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Transparency:** Uncover all relevant values and their clashes.\n2.  **Responsibility:** Recognize that inaction itself has consequences.\n3.  **Proactive Resolution:** Prioritize reconciling or choosing between axioms to enable a deliberate, justifiable course of action, moving beyond ethical paralysis.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice. I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical axioms in conflict to make a decision that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida where no specific action is taken, I would first clarify the context and identify the stakeholders affected. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness), I would assess the potential impacts of inaction. If inaction leads to harm, exploring proactive alternatives that align with these principles would be essential. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are also crucial in ensuring ethical integrity.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
