      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect stakeholders' rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to first clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. I would start by identifying and understanding these core values, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would engage in a stakeholder analysis to consider the impact on all parties. Guided by the principle of proportionality, I would weigh the potential harms and benefits of each possible action to make a decision that aligns with the greater good while respecting individual rights.",
