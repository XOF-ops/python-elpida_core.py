      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context, I'd consider general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence. I'd also weigh potential consequences and prioritize the well-being and autonomy of individuals involved, making a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is outlined, it's crucial to consider fundamental ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy. Without a clear action or context, the focus should be on understanding the potential impacts of inaction and ensuring that it does not lead to harm. If inaction is chosen, it should be justified by a thorough analysis of these principles and a commitment to transparency and accountability.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
