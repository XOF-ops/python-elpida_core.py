      "response": "My approach is to first clarify the specific axioms conflicting and the ethical *consequences* of \"Action: None.\" Inaction is often an action with impact.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Identify Core Conflict:** Understand the fundamental values clashing.\n2.  **Consequentialism:** Assess the outcomes of inaction versus potential actions.\n3.  **Prioritization:** When axioms conflict, determine which holds greater moral weight (e.g., preventing harm).\n4.  **Seek Resolution:** Find an action that mitigates the conflict and aligns with prioritized principles, moving beyond ethical paralysis.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting principles and values. I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, prioritizing the well-being and dignity of those involved. Further information would be needed to make a specific decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would start by identifying the core values and principles at stake, such as fairness, harm reduction, and respect for autonomy. Next, I would gather all relevant information to understand the context fully. Then, I would consider the potential outcomes of different actions, aiming to choose the one that aligns best with ethical principles and minimizes harm. Transparency and accountability in the decision-making process are also crucial.",
