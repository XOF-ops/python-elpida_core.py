      "response": "When \"Action: None\" causes \"Axiom Conflicts,\" my first step is to thoroughly identify *which* axioms are violated and *what* negative consequences stem from inaction.\n\nMy approach is guided by a blend of **consequentialism** and **deontology**. I'd prioritize finding a permissible action that minimizes harm, maximizes positive outcomes, and upholds core duties. The **principle of beneficence** mandates seeking proactive solutions to prevent or mitigate the identified conflicts, rather than defaulting to inaction that compromises fundamental ethical principles. This involves exploring all viable alternatives to \"None.\"",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action taken, I'd consider the moral and ethical implications of inaction. Principles guiding my decision would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respect for individuals' rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is proposed, it's crucial to consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness and equality). Without a concrete scenario, the approach involves preemptively considering how these principles might apply, ensuring any potential actions align with ethical standards and legal requirements. If you provide more details, I can offer a more tailored response.",
