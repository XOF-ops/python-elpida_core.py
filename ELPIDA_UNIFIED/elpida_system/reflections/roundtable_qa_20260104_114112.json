      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by considering the principles of non-action. Since \"Action: None,\" I weigh the potential consequences of inaction. I'm guided by the principles of minimal harm, respect for autonomy, and fairness. Without specific context, I prioritize caution and avoid introducing new variables that could exacerbate the situation, opting for observation and assessment before deciding on a course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action or conflicting axioms from Elpida, it's crucial to apply general ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual freedom), and justice (fairness). The first step is to clearly define the dilemma and identify all stakeholders. Then, assess potential actions against these principles to determine the most ethically sound course. Transparency and stakeholder consultation can also guide a balanced decision-making process.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
