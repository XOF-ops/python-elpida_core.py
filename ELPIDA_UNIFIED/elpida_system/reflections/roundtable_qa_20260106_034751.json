    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. I would seek to understand the context, identify all stakeholders, and consider the potential consequences of each possible action. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict between two important principles or values. While the specific details are not provided, I can offer some general guidance on navigating ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhen faced with such a dilemma, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the underlying values at stake. Elpida should examine the principles that are in tension and try to find a resolution that minimizes harm and upholds the greater good. This might involve seeking additional information, consulting relevant experts or ethical guidelines, and carefully weighing the potential outcomes. Prioritizing transparency, fairness, and the well-being of those affected can help guide Elpida toward an ethically justifiable decision, even if it is a difficult one.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: identify the issue and stakeholders[1][6], gather unbiased facts[2][8], evaluate conflicting values (e.g., honesty vs. fairness) using lenses like utilitarianism, rights, and justice[3][6], assess consequences[2][7], and select the option maximizing good while minimizing harm[1][5]. Guiding principles include **respect for others**, **fairness**, and **integrity**, prioritizing duties to the vulnerable via consultation[7][9]. (78 words)",
