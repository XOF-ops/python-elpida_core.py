I'd consider principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I'd first clarify the situation and identify conflicting axioms or values. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act for the good of others), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness). The goal is to find a balanced resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits, while respecting all involved parties' rights and ensuring fair treatment.",
