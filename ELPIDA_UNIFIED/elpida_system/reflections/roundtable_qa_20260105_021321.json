      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma, I would first clarify the specific ethical principles in conflict. Guided by the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), I would assess the potential impacts of taking no action. If inaction could lead to harm, I would consider what proactive steps could mitigate negative outcomes while aligning with ethical standards. Transparency and stakeholder communication are also crucial to ensure all parties are informed and can provide input.",
