      "response": "This dilemma signals that \"None\" is an unsustainable and unethical stance, as inaction is actively causing foundational conflicts.\n\nMy approach:\n1.  **Identify Specific Axioms:** Determine precisely which axioms are being violated and the consequences of \"None.\"\n2.  **Assess Severity:** Understand the depth of the conflict and the harm caused by inaction.\n\nGuiding principles:\n*   **Duty to Act:** A moral imperative exists to intervene when inaction breaches fundamental ethical principles or causes harm.\n*   **Harm Prevention:** Prioritize actions that resolve these conflicts, mitigate negative impacts, and uphold core values.",

You've mentioned \"ELPIDA\" and included categories like \"Action\" and \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but haven't described the actual dilemma itself.\n\nTo apply ethical decision-making frameworks effectively, I need to understand:\n\n- **What is the specific situation or decision you're facing?**\n- **Who are the stakeholders involved?**\n- **What values or principles are in conflict?**\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through a structured approach using established frameworks like consequentialism, deontology, or virtue ethics, helping you weigh competing values and identify the most ethically sound course of action[1][2][3].",
