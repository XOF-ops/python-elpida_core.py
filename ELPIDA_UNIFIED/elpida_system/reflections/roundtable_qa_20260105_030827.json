      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical implications and potential long-term effects on all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, it's crucial to identify the core values and principles at stake. Guided by principles such as fairness, transparency, and respect for autonomy, I would first clarify the conflicting axioms. Next, I would seek to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders involved. Finally, I would aim to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity, ensuring that the decision respects human rights and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict with their axioms or core principles. While the specifics of the dilemma are not provided, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a situation:\n\n- **Clarify the Axioms:** Elpida should first ensure a clear understanding of the axioms or ethical principles that are at odds. Identifying the specific values or beliefs that are in tension is crucial.\n\n- **Seek Additional Information:** Gathering more facts and details about the situation might help uncover potential solutions. Sometimes, a lack of information can make a dilemma appear more challenging than it is.\n\n- **Consider Alternatives:** Explore a range of possible actions. Even if the initial instinct is to take no action, evaluating different options can reveal creative solutions that align with Elpida's axioms.\n\n- **Consult and Collaborate:** Discussing the dilemma with trusted colleagues or experts in ethics can provide valuable insights and perspectives.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**, evaluate alternatives' consequences, and select the most ethical option with transparent implementation and review.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, drawn from frameworks like utilitarianism and deontology.[3][4] This ensures balanced, defensible decisions.[7] (78 words)",
