      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach the dilemma by identifying the axiom conflicts and considering the ethical implications. Principles guiding my decision include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that balance competing values and minimize harm. Ultimately, I prioritize the well-being and dignity of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the key is to balance the principles involved. I would start by identifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, and non-maleficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of each value. The goal is to find a resolution that minimizes harm and respects all parties involved, guided by the principle of proportionality and the greater good.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and maximizing well-being while respecting rights [4][3]. This ensures transparency and integrity. (78 words)",
