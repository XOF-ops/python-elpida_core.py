      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting principles and evaluating their moral implications. I'd consider principles like respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence to guide my decision, weighing the potential consequences of each possible action and inaction.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties involved. Dialogue and transparency are crucial in finding a mutually acceptable solution.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might result in a conflict with their axioms or core principles. While the specific details are not provided, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a dilemma:\n\n- **Clarify the Axioms**: Elpida should carefully examine and understand the underlying principles that are in tension. Identifying the specific axioms at odds with each other is crucial to finding a resolution.\n\n- **Seek Additional Information**: Gathering more facts and perspectives can help make an informed decision. Elpida might consider consulting relevant experts, stakeholders, or ethical advisors to gain insights and potential solutions.\n\n- **Prioritize Values**: When faced with a conflict, it is essential to weigh the consequences and prioritize the values at stake. Elpida should consider the potential impact of their decision on various parties and choose the action that aligns with the greater good.\n\n- **Consider Alternatives**: Exploring different options and creative solutions is vital to ethical decision-making. Elpida might brainstorm alternative actions to resolve the dilemma while staying true to their core values.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**, evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology), then select and implement the best option with transparency.[1][2][3] Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains, fostering trust.[4][7] (68 words)",
