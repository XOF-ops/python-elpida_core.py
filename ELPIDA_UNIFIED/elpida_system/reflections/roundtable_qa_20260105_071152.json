      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context provided, I would consider general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I would also examine potential axiom conflicts, weighing competing values and interests to guide my decision-making process.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all stakeholders' rights and choices. Open dialogue and transparency are crucial in navigating such complexities.",
