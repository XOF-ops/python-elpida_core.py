      "response": "My approach would be:\n\n1.  **Identify Specific Axiom Conflicts:** Pinpoint *which* axioms are violated by \"None\" and understand the severity of each conflict.\n2.  **Brainstorm Alternatives:** If inaction is problematic, what other actions are possible? Evaluate each against *all* relevant axioms.\n3.  **Prioritize Axioms:** Principles guiding my decision include a hierarchy of values. Which axioms are most fundamental or prevent the greatest harm?\n4.  **Seek Least Harm/Most Good:** Choose the action (even if imperfect) that minimizes overall axiom violation or best upholds the most critical principles, accepting that compromise might be necessary. Transparency in the decision process is key.",
