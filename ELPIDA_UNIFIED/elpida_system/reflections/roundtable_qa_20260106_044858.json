    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include the duty to act, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I'd weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of intervention, considering the moral and ethical implications of each option.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. I would also seek to understand the context and perspectives of all stakeholders involved. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action could potentially lead to conflicting outcomes, as suggested by the \"Axiom Conflicts\" mentioned. When considering ethical dilemmas, it's crucial to prioritize transparency and accountability. Elpida should first gather all relevant information to understand the consequences of inaction. This includes assessing the potential risks and benefits associated with each axiom. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the duty to do no harm. By taking no action, Elpida might aim to prevent any potential negative outcomes. However, it's essential to balance this with the responsibility to act if the situation demands intervention to promote overall well-being. Elpida's decision should aim to minimize harm and ensure the greatest good, considering the specific details of the scenario.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, map stakeholders and motivations, apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**, evaluate options' consequences, select the best alternative, implement transparently, and review outcomes.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles include utilitarianism (maximizing good), deontology (duty-based rights), and justice (fairness for all).[3][4][6] This ensures balanced, defensible decisions.
