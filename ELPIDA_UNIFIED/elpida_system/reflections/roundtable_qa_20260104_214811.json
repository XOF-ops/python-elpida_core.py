    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by clarifying the context and identifying the axioms at conflict. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the ethical implications of inaction. Principles guiding my decision would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and autonomy (respecting individuals' rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), and justice (fairness and equality), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial to ensure all perspectives are considered. The goal is to find a resolution that respects all involved parties while upholding ethical standards.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in an ethical dilemma due to conflicting axioms or values. When faced with such a dilemma, it's important to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the underlying principles at play. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the principle of beneficence, which encourages actions that promote the well-being of others. Inaction could potentially harm someone, and taking proactive steps to prevent harm is often morally justifiable. Another relevant concept is the duty to act, which suggests that individuals have a moral obligation to intervene when they can prevent something bad from happening. \n\nElpida should carefully analyze the situation, seeking additional information to clarify the nature of the conflict and potential resolutions. A balanced approach, considering both the benefits and potential drawbacks of action or inaction, is essential to making an ethical decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate stakeholders and competing values, apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**, assess consequences, then select and implement the best option while monitoring outcomes.[1][2][3]\n\nGuiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, drawing from frameworks like utilitarianism and deontology for balanced, transparent decisions.[3][4]",
