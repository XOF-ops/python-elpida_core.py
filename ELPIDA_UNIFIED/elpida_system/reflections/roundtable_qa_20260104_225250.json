      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). Since the action is \"none,\" I would weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking no action, and consider alternative courses of action that might promote the well-being of those involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action presented, it's crucial to identify the underlying values and principles at stake. I would start by clarifying the conflicting axioms to understand the core of the issue. Guided by principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting all parties involved. If more context is provided, a more tailored response can be offered.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a situation where taking no action might lead to a conflict between two important principles or values. To navigate this dilemma, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of inaction:\n\n**Identify the Axioms:** First, determine the specific axioms or ethical principles that are in tension. Understanding the nature of the conflict is essential for finding a resolution. \n\n**Consider Alternatives:** Explore the options for action, even if they seem minor. Sometimes, a small intervention can prevent a larger issue. Inaction might be justifiable if it prevents a greater harm or if there are no clear alternatives that would improve the situation without causing other ethical concerns. \n\n**Minimize Harm:** The principle of 'do no harm' is a fundamental ethical guideline. Evaluate the potential outcomes to ensure that your decision does not cause unnecessary harm to anyone involved.",
