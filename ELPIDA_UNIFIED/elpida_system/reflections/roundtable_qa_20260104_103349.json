I would then proactively explore alternative actions to resolve or mitigate these conflicts, seeking the option that best upholds critical axioms or minimizes harm.\n\nGuiding principles include proactive responsibility to address the harm caused by inaction (non-maleficence), committed problem-solving, and prioritizing foundational ethical axioms\u2014especially those concerning safety and well-being\u2014when difficult choices are necessary.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. (78 words)",
