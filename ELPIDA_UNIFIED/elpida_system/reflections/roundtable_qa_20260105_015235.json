      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the importance of each axiom, seeking a balance that promotes the greater good while minimizing harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and axiom conflicts, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting principles. Guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial in navigating such complexities.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions [7]. (78 words)",
