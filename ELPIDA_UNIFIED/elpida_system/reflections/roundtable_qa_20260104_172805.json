Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh potential consequences, consider multiple perspectives, and prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability to inform my decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would analyze how each principle applies to the scenario. The goal is to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all stakeholders' rights and ensuring fairness.",

You've referenced \"ELPIDA\" and mentioned \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but haven't described the actual ethical situation, the competing values involved, or the stakeholders affected.\n\nTo apply an ethical decision-making framework, I would need:\n\n- **The specific scenario or problem** you're facing\n- **The conflicting principles or values** at stake\n- **Who is affected** by the decision\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can help you work through the dilemma using established ethical principles like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3], and guide you through a structured decision-making process[1][2].",
