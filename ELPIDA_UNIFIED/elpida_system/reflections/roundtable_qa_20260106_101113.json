      "success": true,
      "response": "With \"Action: None\" causing axiom conflicts, I view inaction as a decision with ethical implications. My approach is to first identify the *specific* conflicting axioms and understand the harms or injustices perpetuated by doing nothing.\n\nPrinciples guiding this:\n1.  **Active Responsibility:** Not acting is still a choice, and it carries ethical weight.\n2.  **Harm Reduction:** Seek to prevent or mitigate negative consequences arising from the conflicts or inaction.\n3.  **Integrity:** Strive for an action that best upholds and reconciles core ethical principles, rather than letting them clash unresolved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits and harms of alternative actions, considering the ethical axioms in conflict to make a decision that promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual freedom), and justice (fairness). Without specific actions or contexts, reflecting on these axioms helps in preparing a framework for decision-making. If faced with a particular scenario, I would assess how each potential action aligns or conflicts with these principles to determine the most ethically sound course.",
