      "success": true,
      "response": "My approach would be to first **identify and fully understand the specific 'axiom conflicts'** and the underlying *reasons* for 'no action.' Inaction itself is a choice with ethical implications.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Duty to Act:** Determine if there's a moral obligation to intervene to prevent harm or uphold values.\n2.  **Consequentialism:** Analyze potential negative outcomes of inaction and seek alternatives that minimize harm.\n3.  **Integrity/Consistency:** Strive for actions that resolve conflicts and align with core values.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd identify the core issue, gather relevant information, and weigh competing values. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and balance individual interests with the greater good, striving for a fair and just decision that respects all parties involved.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to assess the potential impacts of inaction. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), one must consider whether inaction could lead to greater harm than taking a specific action. Transparency and accountability in decision-making processes are also vital, ensuring that all stakeholders understand the rationale behind choosing inaction. This approach balances the conflicting axioms while striving to uphold ethical standards.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action itself becomes the crux of the ethical dilemma, highlighting the challenge of inaction and its potential consequences. The principle of 'benevolence' could guide my decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of actively promoting good and preventing harm. Inaction could potentially lead to harm if it allows for the continuation of an unethical situation. \n\nAnother guiding principle might be 'justice,' which entails treating people fairly and equitably. Inaction may perpetuate an unjust situation, especially if it involves a violation of rights or an imbalance of power. Therefore, taking action, even if it's a small step, could be ethically justifiable to initiate change or address a pressing issue. \n\nThe key is to balance the potential risks and benefits of acting versus not acting, always striving to minimize harm and promote the greatest good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I appreciate your question, but I notice the specific ethical dilemma details from \"ELPIDA\" haven't been provided in your query. To give you meaningful guidance, I'd need to understand:\n\n- **What is the actual situation or conflict?**\n- **What competing values or actions are at stake?**\n- **Who are the stakeholders involved?**\n\nOnce you share the dilemma, I can apply established frameworks[1][2][3] including identifying stakeholders, examining consequences, applying ethical principles like autonomy and justice[3], and evaluating competing values to help you reach a sound decision.",
