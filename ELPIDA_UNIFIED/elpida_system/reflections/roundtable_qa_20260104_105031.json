      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where she has to consider the principles of honesty and the potential consequences of her actions. The dilemma revolves around whether or not to reveal the truth about her friend's partner's infidelity. \n\nElpida's decision should be guided by several principles:\n\n1. Honesty: Elpida should consider the importance of being truthful, especially in close relationships. Revealing the truth might be the right thing to do to maintain trust and integrity.\n\n2. Friendship and Loyalty: She should weigh the potential impact of her actions on her friendship. Breaking this news might cause strain, but withholding information could also lead to feelings of betrayal later. \n\n3. Minimizing Harm: Elpida must consider the potential consequences and choose the action that causes the least harm to all involved parties.",
