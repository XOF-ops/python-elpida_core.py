      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. I'd consider principles like respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of those involved, seeking a solution that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where no specific action is taken, the guiding principles are often those of non-maleficence (do no harm) and respect for autonomy. It's crucial to evaluate whether inaction could lead to harm or if it respects the individuals' rights and choices involved. If inaction aligns with these principles and there are no conflicting axioms, it may be the most ethically sound choice. However, continuous monitoring and reassessment are necessary to ensure that the situation does not evolve into one requiring intervention.",
