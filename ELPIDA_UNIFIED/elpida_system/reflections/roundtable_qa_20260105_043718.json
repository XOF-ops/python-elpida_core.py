      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is indicated, it's crucial to clarify the context and identify the conflicting axioms or principles. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. I would seek to understand the core issues, stakeholders involved, and potential consequences of inaction. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are vital to navigate the conflict responsibly and ethically.",
