      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits of intervention, considering the ethical principles of justice, fairness, and compassion to inform my decision.",

      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a challenging situation where taking no action might seem like the easiest option, but it could potentially lead to more significant issues in the future. The absence of action indicates a need to consider the underlying principles and values at play. \n\nOne guiding principle could be the duty to act responsibly and in the best interest of all stakeholders. Inaction can sometimes cause harm, especially if the situation requires immediate attention or resolution. Elpida should consider the potential consequences and evaluate if taking no action is truly ethical. Transparency and accountability are key values here; understanding the reasons for not acting and communicating them effectively might be essential to justifying this decision. \n\nA careful assessment of the situation and its potential long-term impact is necessary to make an informed choice.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **assess stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][7]. Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over short-term gains. (78 words)",
