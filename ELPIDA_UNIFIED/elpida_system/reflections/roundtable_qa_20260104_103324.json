What fundamental values, duties, or responsibilities are at stake?\n\nMy decision would be guided by:\n1.  **Non-maleficence:** Does \"None\" cause or allow harm by omission?\n2.  **Deontology:** Are there duties or rules (e.g., to intervene, prevent injustice) that inaction would violate?\n3.  **Consequentialism:** What are the predicted long-term outcomes of inaction for all stakeholders? Does it truly maximize overall well-being or lead to greater harm?\n4.  **Responsibility:** Is there a moral obligation to act, even if difficult?",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over short-term gains [4][8]. (78 words)",
