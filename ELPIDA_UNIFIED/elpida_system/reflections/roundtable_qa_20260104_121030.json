    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the ethical theories of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics to inform my decision. Ultimately, I would prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing this dilemma, the first step is to clarify the specific ethical conflict and the context. However, given the lack of details, I would generally approach it by prioritizing principles such as transparency, accountability, and the well-being of all stakeholders. Ensuring that actions are justifiable and defensible from an ethical standpoint is crucial. If no action is required, it might be because the situation is already aligned with ethical standards, or further information is needed to make an informed decision.",

However, a general **ethical decision-making approach** involves:[1][2]\n\n1. **Identify the issue** \u2014 What ethical conflict exists?\n2. **Gather facts** \u2014 Collect unbiased information and stakeholder perspectives\n3. **Apply ethical principles** \u2014 Consider autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3]\n4. **Evaluate consequences** \u2014 Assess short and long-term impacts\n5. **Consult others** \u2014 Seek diverse perspectives\n6. **Choose and implement** \u2014 Select the option best balancing ethics, practicality, and stakeholder impact[3]\n\n**Key principle**: When choosing between competing values (\"right vs. right\"), prioritize respect for others and awareness of justice.[8]\n\nCould you share Elpida's specific situation?",
