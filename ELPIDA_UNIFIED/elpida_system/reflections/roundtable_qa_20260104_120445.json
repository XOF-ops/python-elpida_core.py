      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address this dilemma, I would first clarify the specific ethical conflict and context. Guided by the principles of transparency, accountability, and harm minimization, I would seek to understand the potential impacts of inaction. If no action is required, it suggests that the status quo aligns with ethical standards. However, continuous monitoring and open communication with stakeholders are essential to ensure that no underlying issues are overlooked.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might lead to potential harm. The absence of information about the specific axiom conflicts makes it challenging to provide an in-depth response. However, a general principle to consider is the concept of \"do no harm\" or non-maleficence, which is a fundamental ethical guideline. This principle suggests that one should refrain from causing harm to others, especially when there is a possibility of adverse consequences. \n\nElpida's decision should be guided by a thorough assessment of the situation. She should consider gathering more information to understand the potential outcomes of her inaction. If there is a chance that someone might be harmed, she may want to consider taking proactive steps to prevent it, especially if her actions (or lack thereof) could significantly impact someone's well-being. Prioritizing the safety and welfare of others is a crucial ethical consideration.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence) [3][4], **evaluate options and consequences** using frameworks like utilitarianism or deontology [2][3], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical solution [1][3]. Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over expediency [6][8]. (78 words)",
