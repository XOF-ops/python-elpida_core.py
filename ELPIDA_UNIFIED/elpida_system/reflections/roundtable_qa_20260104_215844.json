      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the potential benefits of intervention, considering the ethical principles of fairness, justice, and compassion to make a decision that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing this dilemma, the first step is to clarify the specific ethical conflict involved. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy (honor individual choices) are crucial. If the action is \"None,\" it suggests a passive approach, which might be justified if intervening would cause more harm. However, transparency and communication with all stakeholders are essential to ensure that the decision is well-informed and ethically sound.",
