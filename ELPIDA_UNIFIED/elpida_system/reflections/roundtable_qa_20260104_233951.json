    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since there's no action taken, I'd consider the moral principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that balance competing values and promote the well-being of all parties involved.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision. I would also seek to understand the context and perspectives of all stakeholders involved. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting ethical norms.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially impact her relationship with her friend and her own personal beliefs. Here are some guiding principles to consider:\n\n1. Honesty and Transparency: Elpida should consider whether being open and honest with her friend about her feelings is important to maintaining their friendship. Hiding her true emotions might create a rift in the long run. \n\n2. Respect for Boundaries: It is crucial to respect personal boundaries. Elpida might want to assess if her friend is comfortable with physical affection and whether this gesture would be welcomed. \n\n3. Self-Reflection: Elpida can reflect on her own values and comfort levels. Understanding her feelings and why she hesitates can help her make an informed decision. \n\nElpida's decision should aim to balance her respect for her friend's boundaries and her own emotional needs.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, apply principles like **nonmaleficence** (avoid harm), **justice** (fairness), and **beneficence** (promote well-being), evaluate alternatives' consequences, then select and implement the most ethical option while monitoring outcomes[1][2][3]. Guiding principles prioritize integrity, stakeholder impacts, and long-term good over short-term gains[4][7]. (78 words)",
