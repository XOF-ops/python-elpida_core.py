      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, the key is to identify and balance conflicting axioms or principles. I would start by clarifying the core values at stake, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would consider the context and potential consequences of inaction versus any possible actions. The goal is to find a resolution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity, guided by transparency, fairness, and respect for all stakeholders involved.",
