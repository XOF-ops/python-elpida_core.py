My decision would be guided by:\n\n*   **Consequentialism:** Assessing the potential harm or benefit resulting from inaction, aiming to minimize harm and maximize overall well-being.\n*   **Deontology:** Identifying if a moral duty or obligation to act exists, especially concerning protection or responsibility.\n*   **Justice:** Evaluating if inaction leads to an unjust or inequitable outcome for any party.\n\nThe goal is to weigh these conflicting axioms to determine the most ethically defensible course.",

Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and integrity over expediency [4][6]. (78 words)",
