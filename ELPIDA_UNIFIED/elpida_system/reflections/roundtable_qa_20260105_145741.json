      "success": true,
      "response": "This dilemma indicates that inaction itself is a problematic choice, generating ethical conflicts. My approach would be guided by the principle of **active responsibility**.\n\nWhen \"Action: None\" conflicts with core axioms, it's a moral imperative to intervene. I would first fully understand *which* axioms are violated and the *consequences* of inaction. Principles of **minimizing harm** and **upholding foundational values** would then guide me to identify and implement the necessary action to resolve the conflicts and align with Elpida's core principles. Inaction is not a neutral stance here.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting values and principles. I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, prioritizing the well-being and safety of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the key is to engage in reflective equilibrium. This involves balancing core ethical principles such as justice, autonomy, and non-maleficence. I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders involved, and potential consequences of each conflicting axiom. The goal is to find a resolution that minimizes harm and respects the values of all parties, while aligning with overarching ethical standards.",
