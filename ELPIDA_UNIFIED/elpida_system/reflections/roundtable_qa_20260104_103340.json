Determine if one axiom inherently outweighs others in this context.\n3.  **Analyze Alternatives:** Explore if any action (or refined inaction) can better navigate or mitigate the axiom conflicts.\n4.  **Contextual Review:** Understand the broader implications of inaction versus a potentially conflicting action.\n5.  **Escalate:** If no resolution is clear, present the dilemma, conflicting axioms, and potential impacts to human review for a guided decision.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and maximizing well-being for all involved[3][4]. (78 words)",
