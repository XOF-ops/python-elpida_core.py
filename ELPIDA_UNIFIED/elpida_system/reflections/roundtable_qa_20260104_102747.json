      "response": "Approaching a dilemma where \"None\" conflicts with axioms means recognizing inaction itself as an unethical choice. My first step is to identify the specific axioms being violated and the consequences of inaction.\n\nGuiding principles:\n1.  **Active Responsibility:** Acknowledge the duty to intervene when core principles are compromised.\n2.  **Minimizing Harm:** Seek an action that reduces negative impacts or prevents further axiom violations.\n3.  **Upholding Principles:** Prioritize finding an action that aligns with and reinforces the conflicted axioms, rather than passively allowing their breach.\n\nThe goal is to find a constructive intervention.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision, especially if she strongly believes in the importance of both axioms. \n\nOne approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Elpida should evaluate whether her silence or lack of intervention could lead to further harm or injustice. Sometimes, taking no action can inadvertently support an existing harmful situation. \n\nAnother guiding principle could be the idea of personal agency and responsibility. Elpida might reflect on her ability to make a difference and whether her actions could potentially alleviate the conflict between the two axioms. Balancing these principles and considering the specific context will help her make an informed decision.",
