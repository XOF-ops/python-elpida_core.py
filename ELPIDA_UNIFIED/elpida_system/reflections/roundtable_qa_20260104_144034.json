      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider the moral implications of not taking a stance, guiding my decision with empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would start by clarifying the context and identifying the conflicting axioms or principles involved. The guiding principles include transparency, fairness, respect for autonomy, and harm minimization. I would seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the potential consequences of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that aligns with ethical standards and respects the values of all parties involved.",

Without understanding the particular ethical dilemma you're facing, I can't offer targeted guidance.\n\nHowever, I can outline the general approach: **identify the ethical issue**, **gather facts**, **recognize stakeholders**, **apply ethical principles** (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3], and **evaluate consequences**[2]. Consult colleagues and align decisions with professional values[6].\n\nCould you describe the specific dilemma? That would enable me to provide relevant guidance.",
