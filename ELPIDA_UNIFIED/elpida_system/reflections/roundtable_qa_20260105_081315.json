      "success": true,
      "response": "When \"Action: None\" causes axiom conflicts, it highlights that inaction is a choice with ethical weight. My approach involves:\n\n1.  **Identifying Specific Conflicts:** Pinpoint which moral axioms (e.g., duty, justice, welfare) are violated by inaction and the resulting harm.\n2.  **Principle of Active Responsibility:** Recognize that 'none' isn't neutral; it has consequences.\n3.  **Seeking Proactive Solutions:** Evaluate alternative actions to mitigate harm, uphold duties, or achieve a more just outcome. Prioritize choices that minimize overall conflict and best align with core ethical principles, even if an ideal solution is elusive.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against possible alternatives, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those involved. Further information is needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, I would start by clarifying the core values at stake and the context of the situation. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties involved. If more details were provided, I could offer a more tailored response.",
