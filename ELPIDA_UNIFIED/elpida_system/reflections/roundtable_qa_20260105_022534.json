      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach this dilemma by considering the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). Since no action is specified, I prioritize gathering more information to inform a decision that balances these principles and minimizes harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Engaging in dialogue with all parties to understand their perspectives can help in finding a resolution that respects ethical principles and promotes a harmonious outcome.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is facing a challenging situation where taking no action might seem like the easiest option, but it could potentially lead to more significant issues in the future. The absence of action suggests a lack of decision-making, which can be problematic, especially if the situation requires immediate attention or resolution. \n\nElpida should consider the potential consequences of inaction and evaluate the urgency of the matter. Taking a passive stance might be appropriate in some cases, but it should be a conscious decision backed by ethical principles. These principles could include causing no harm, respecting autonomy, and ensuring that any decision (or lack thereof) promotes fairness and justice. Elpida must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of acting versus not acting to make an informed choice.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions.[2][6] (78 words)",
