      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting principles and evaluating their moral implications. I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences, then apply principles like respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence to guide my decision, ensuring a fair and just outcome.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is outlined and there are conflicting axioms, the key is to identify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes harm while promoting the greatest good for all involved. Clarifying the context and stakeholders' interests can further aid in resolving the conflict.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially impact her relationship with her family and her personal growth. Here are some guiding principles to consider:\n\n**Honesty and Communication:** Elpida should consider being open and honest with her family about her aspirations and the reasons for her unhappiness. Transparent communication can help resolve misunderstandings and foster a supportive environment.\n\n**Self-Reflection:** It is essential for Elpida to introspect and understand her own desires and goals. She should evaluate her priorities and consider whether her current situation aligns with her long-term aspirations.\n\n**Balance and Compromise:** Finding a balance between family expectations and personal goals is crucial. Elpida might explore potential compromises that respect her family's wishes while also allowing her to pursue her own path. This could involve negotiating a plan that accommodates both her education and her family's needs.",
