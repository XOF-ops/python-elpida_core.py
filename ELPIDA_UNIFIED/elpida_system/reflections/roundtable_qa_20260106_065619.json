      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against possible alternatives, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those affected. Further information is needed to make a specific decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. The guiding principles include beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness). I would seek to understand the stakeholders' perspectives, the potential outcomes, and any cultural or legal considerations. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit while respecting all parties involved.",
