      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context provided, I would consider general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I would weigh potential consequences and consider the perspectives of all parties involved to guide my decision, ensuring it aligns with these core principles.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action, it's crucial to clarify the underlying issues and potential conflicts. Guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and respect for autonomy, I would first seek to understand all stakeholders' perspectives and the broader context. This involves identifying the core values at stake, such as justice, fairness, and harm prevention. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes negative impacts and aligns with ethical standards. If more information is needed, further inquiry is essential.",

Guiding principles include **fairness, respect for autonomy, and maximizing good while minimizing harm**[2][3], prioritizing integrity over short-term gains. (78 words)",
