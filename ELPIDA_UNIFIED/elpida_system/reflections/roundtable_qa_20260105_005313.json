      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I would consider the principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that promote the well-being and safety of all parties involved, guided by empathy, fairness, and respect for autonomy.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address the ethical dilemma from Elpida, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms and principles involved. I would start by clarifying the specific ethical issues at stake, such as harm vs. benefit, autonomy vs. paternalism, or justice vs. mercy. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), respect for autonomy, and fairness, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and respects all parties' rights and dignity. If more context is provided, a more detailed analysis can be offered.",

      "response": "I'd be happy to help you approach an ethical dilemma, but your query appears incomplete. You've referenced \"ELPIDA\" and mention \"Action: None\" and \"Axiom Conflicts\" without providing the actual dilemma details.\n\nTo apply a structured approach, I need to understand:\n\n- **What is the specific situation or problem?**\n- **What conflicting values or principles are at stake?**\n- **Who are the stakeholders involved?**\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through a **systematic framework**: identify the ethical issues, gather facts, consider stakeholder perspectives, apply ethical principles (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3], evaluate consequences, and select the most ethical option[1].\n\nPlease share the dilemma details, and I'll provide targeted guidance.",
