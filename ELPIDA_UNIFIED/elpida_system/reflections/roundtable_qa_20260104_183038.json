      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek clarification on the specific scenario and the conflicting axioms involved. Guided by principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, my approach would involve analyzing the potential impacts of different actions, ensuring that any decision respects all parties' rights and promotes the greater good while minimizing harm. If you can provide more details about the dilemma, I can offer a more tailored response.",
