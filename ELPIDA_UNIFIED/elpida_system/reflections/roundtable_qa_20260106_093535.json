      "success": true,
      "response": "My approach would be to first recognize \"Action: None\" as a significant ethical choice, not an absence of one. I would then pinpoint the specific axioms (e.g., justice, duty, non-maleficence) being conflicted, and analyze the direct and indirect harm or injustice resulting from this inaction.\n\nPrinciples guiding my decision include:\n*   **Responsibility & Duty:** We often have an ethical duty to act, especially when harm is preventable or justice is compromised.\n*   **Non-Maleficence:** A primary commitment to avoid causing or allowing harm.\n*   **Accountability:** Acknowledging that inaction carries ethical weight and consequences.",

    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the moral principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh the potential consequences of inaction and consider alternative courses of action that align with these principles, prioritizing the well-being and safety of those involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is taken, the guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness). Without a clear scenario, I emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and continuous ethical reflection to ensure that inaction does not lead to unintended negative consequences. Each situation requires a careful assessment of these principles to navigate the complexities of ethical decision-making.",

    "Perplexity": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts** [1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence [3][9], **evaluate alternatives and consequences** using frameworks such as utilitarianism or deontology [2][6], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option [1][3]. Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and stakeholder well-being while fostering transparency.[64 words]",
