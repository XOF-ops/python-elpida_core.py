      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I would consider the consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh the potential harm of inaction against the potential benefits of taking action, considering the ethical implications of each option.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the underlying principles at stake. I would start by clarifying the conflicting axioms to understand the core values in tension. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while ensuring fairness and respecting individual rights. If more context is provided, I can offer a more tailored response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or inactions could potentially lead to a conflict with her personal values or ethical principles. However, without more context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive solution. \n\nWhen faced with ethical dilemmas, it's essential to consider the principles of honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Elpida should evaluate the potential consequences of her actions and inactions and reflect on her personal values. She might ask herself questions like: What are the potential outcomes? Who might be affected, and how? Is there a way to minimize harm and uphold my values? \n\nA thoughtful consideration of these principles and a thorough analysis of the situation will help guide Elpida towards a decision that aligns with her ethical framework while mitigating potential harm.",
