      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy, and justice. I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, or in this case, whether inaction is justified.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no action is specified, it's crucial to clarify the context and the conflicting axioms. Generally, I would apply principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (act in the best interest of others), autonomy (respect for individual freedom), and justice (fairness and equality). The goal is to identify the core ethical issues, assess the potential impacts of inaction, and consider stakeholder perspectives to guide a principled decision. If more details were provided, a more specific analysis could be offered.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida is faced with a situation where taking no action might result in conflicting outcomes regarding the axioms of benevolence and justice. \n\nElpida's decision to remain passive could be guided by the principle of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the avoidance of causing harm. By not intervening, Elpida ensures that they are not directly responsible for any potential negative consequences. This approach prioritizes maintaining the status quo and minimizing the risk of causing harm to others. \n\nHowever, Elpida should also consider the potential benefits of action and the principle of beneficence, which encourages actions that promote the well-being of others. Balancing these principles is crucial, and Elpida might want to gather more information to make an informed decision, ensuring that the chosen path aligns with the greatest good and causes the least harm.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and maximizing well-being while fostering transparency [4][2]. (78 words)",
