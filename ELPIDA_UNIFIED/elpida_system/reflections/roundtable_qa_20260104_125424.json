      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the key stakeholders and their interests. Since no action is taken, I'd consider the consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (promote good), and autonomy (respect individual rights). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm while respecting all parties involved. Open dialogue and transparency can help in understanding different perspectives and finding a mutually acceptable solution.",

Guiding principles prioritize fairness, harm avoidance, and integrity over expediency [4][8]. (78 words)",
