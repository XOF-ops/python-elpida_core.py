      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision. Sometimes, doing nothing can be a powerful choice, especially when there is a potential conflict between personal beliefs and professional responsibilities. \n\nElpida's guiding principles in this case could be:\n\n1. **Respect for Autonomy:** Elpida might prioritize the individual's right to make their own decisions, even if it means not interfering. \n\n2. **Non-Maleficence:** The decision to take no action could be driven by the principle of 'do no harm'. Elpida may believe that any intervention might cause more harm than good. \n\n3. **Personal Integrity:** Staying true to her own values and beliefs, especially if they align with causing no harm and respecting individual choices, could be a significant factor in Elpida's decision-making process.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains [4]. (78 words)",
