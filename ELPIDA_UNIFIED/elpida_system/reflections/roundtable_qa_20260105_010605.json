      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I'd approach this dilemma by seeking clarification and context. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against potential benefits, ultimately striving to make a decision that promotes the well-being and dignity of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first clarify the conflicting axioms or principles involved. Understanding these helps in identifying the core ethical issues. I would then apply a framework such as utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics to evaluate the potential impacts of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that respects all stakeholders and aligns with moral values. If you can provide more details about the specific dilemma, I can offer a more tailored response.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision, especially if she strongly believes in the importance of both axioms. \n\nOne approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can lead to implicit support for an existing situation or allow an issue to persist. Elpida could explore whether there are alternative actions that could address both axioms simultaneously or find a compromise. For instance, she could seek more information, consult experts, or propose a discussion to find a solution that respects the rights of the individual and the community while also considering the potential impact on societal harmony. \n\nThe guiding principles here might include prioritizing finding a balanced solution, respecting multiple perspectives, and striving for the greatest good without causing harm.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **identify the issue and stakeholders**, gather unbiased facts, evaluate alternatives using principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence**, assess consequences, and select the most ethical option with transparent implementation and review[1][2][3]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. This ensures balanced, defensible decisions.[62 words]",
