      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context provided, I'd consider general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I'd weigh potential consequences and prioritize the well-being and rights of individuals involved, using a utilitarian or deontological framework to guide my decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, the key is to clarify the underlying values and principles at stake. I would start by identifying the conflicting axioms or ethical principles involved. Then, I would consider the context and potential consequences of each possible stance. Guided by principles such as respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice, I would aim to find a balanced approach that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good. If needed, consulting stakeholders or ethical frameworks can provide additional insights.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where taking no action might be the most challenging decision, especially if she strongly believes in the importance of both axioms. \n\nOne approach could be to consider the potential consequences of inaction. Sometimes, doing nothing can lead to implicit support for an existing situation or allow an issue to persist. Elpida could reflect on whether her silence or lack of intervention might contribute to an outcome that goes against her values. \n\nAnother guiding principle could be the idea of personal agency and responsibility. Elpida might consider if there is an opportunity to take proactive steps, even if they are small, to ensure that her values are represented and that she is contributing to a positive change, no matter how minor. Balancing these principles can help Elpida make an informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue**, gather unbiased facts, map stakeholders and values, apply principles like **autonomy**, **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**, evaluate consequences, and select/implement the best option with review[1][2][3]. Guiding principles prioritize harm avoidance, fairness, and long-term well-being over short-term gains[3][4]. This ensures transparent, defensible decisions[7]. (78 words)",
