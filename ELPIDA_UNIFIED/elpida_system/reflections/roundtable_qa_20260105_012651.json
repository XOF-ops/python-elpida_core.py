      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach by identifying the conflicting principles and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences to make an informed decision that balances competing ethical demands.",

My approach involves understanding all stakeholders involved, the potential impacts of different actions, and aligning with core ethical principles such as fairness, respect for autonomy, and minimizing harm. By carefully weighing these factors, I aim to identify a balanced and principled resolution.",
