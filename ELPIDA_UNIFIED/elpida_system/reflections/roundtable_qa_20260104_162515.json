      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no action is specified, I'd consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it means taking no action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma without a specified action, the first step is to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or values. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. It's essential to weigh these principles, consider all stakeholders, and seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. If more context is provided, a more specific approach can be outlined.",
