      "response": "When \"Action: None\" causes Axiom Conflicts, inaction is unethical. My approach is to proactively identify the specific conflicting axioms and their root cause. Guiding principles are: **Responsibility** to uphold ethical foundations, **Ethical Duty** to act decisively, and **Integrity** to choose a path that best resolves the conflict and aligns with core values, restoring ethical coherence.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "Given the lack of information, I would approach this dilemma by gathering context and clarifying the situation. My decision would be guided by principles of fairness, respect for autonomy, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against possible actions, striving to make a decision that promotes the well-being of all parties involved. Further details are needed to provide a more specific approach.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect for individual choice), and justice (fairness) guide the decision-making process. I would seek to understand the context, identify all stakeholders, and consider the potential consequences of inaction. Balancing these principles helps in making a well-rounded decision that respects ethical standards.",

Your query references \"ELPIDA\" and mentions \"Action: None\" and \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but doesn't describe the actual ethical situation or conflicting principles involved.\n\nTo help you approach this dilemma, I'd need you to clarify:\n- What is the specific ethical situation?\n- What values or principles are in conflict?\n- Who are the stakeholders affected?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through a systematic **ethical decision-making framework** that involves identifying the issue, gathering facts, considering stakeholder perspectives, applying ethical theories, and evaluating consequences[1][2][6].",
