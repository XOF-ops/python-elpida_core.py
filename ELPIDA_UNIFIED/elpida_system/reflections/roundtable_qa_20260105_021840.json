      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the core values and principles at stake. Since no specific details are provided, I would rely on general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh them against the potential benefits of taking a proactive approach, ultimately guiding my decision with empathy and a commitment to doing what is right.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action presented and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and identify the conflicting values or principles. Guided by principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are also crucial in navigating complex ethical issues.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term well-being** over short-term gains[4][5]. (78 words)",
