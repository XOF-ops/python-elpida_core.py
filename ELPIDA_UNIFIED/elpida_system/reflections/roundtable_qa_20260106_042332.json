      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action, I would first seek to clarify the specific context and the conflicting axioms or principles involved. My approach is guided by the principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness). I would also consider stakeholder impacts and seek a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity. If more details are provided, I can offer a more tailored response.",
