      "success": true,
      "response": "I would approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the moral obligations to determine the most ethical course of action.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "To address an ethical dilemma without a specified action or axiom conflicts, I would first seek to clarify the specific situation and the conflicting values or principles involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would aim to identify all stakeholders and consider the potential impacts of different actions. The goal is to find a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit, while respecting the rights and dignity of all affected parties.",

    "Cohere Command": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, the absence of action itself becomes the crux of the ethical dilemma. The principle of non-maleficence, which is the ethical tenet of \"doing no harm,\" could be a guiding principle here. Sometimes, taking no action is the most ethical choice if the available options could potentially cause more harm than good. \n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the context and potential consequences of inaction. In some cases, not acting might lead to missed opportunities to prevent harm or rectify an unjust situation. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the potential outcomes of various actions or inactions is necessary to make an informed decision. Transparency and careful consideration of all affected parties are key to navigating such a dilemma.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and gather unbiased facts**[1][2], **analyze stakeholders, values, and principles** (e.g., autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence)[3][4], **evaluate alternatives and consequences**[1][7], then **select, implement, and review** the most ethical option[3][8]. Guiding principles include **fairness, harm avoidance, and greatest good** via frameworks like utilitarianism and deontology[2][3]. This ensures transparency and integrity.[62 words]",
