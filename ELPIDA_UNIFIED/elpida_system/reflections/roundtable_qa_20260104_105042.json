      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions (or lack thereof) could potentially lead to a conflict with her own axioms or principles. While the specific details are unclear, here are some general guidelines to navigate such a dilemma:\n\n- **Clarify the Axioms**: Elpida should carefully examine her personal values and principles that are in tension. Understanding the underlying beliefs and their significance is crucial.\n\n- **Seek Alternatives**: Explore different options and consider if there are alternative actions that could resolve the conflict. Sometimes, a creative solution can alleviate the dilemma.\n\n- **Prioritize and Compromise**: If the axioms hold equal weight, prioritizing one over the other might be necessary. Compromising and finding a middle ground could be a practical approach, ensuring that the decision aligns with her core values as much as possible.\n\n- **Consult and Reflect**: Discussing the dilemma with trusted individuals can provide new perspectives. Self-reflection is also essential to make an informed and ethically sound decision.",

      "response": "I approach ethical dilemmas systematically: **Identify the issue and stakeholders**[1][2], gather unbiased facts[1][6], apply principles like **autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence**[3], and evaluate consequences using frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology)[2][3]. Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and greatest good** while fostering dialogue[1][6]. Select, implement, and review the most ethical option transparently[3][9]. (78 words)",
