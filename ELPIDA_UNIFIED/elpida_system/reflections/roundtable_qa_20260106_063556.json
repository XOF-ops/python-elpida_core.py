Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good).

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required, it's crucial to identify the conflicting axioms or values at play. I would start by clarifying the core ethical principles involved, such as justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Next, I would consider the context and stakeholders affected. My decision would aim to balance these principles, seeking the least harmful and most equitable outcome. If further guidance is needed, consulting ethical frameworks or seeking input from diverse perspectives can be beneficial.",

Your query references \"ELPIDA\" and mentions \"Action: None\" and \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but doesn't describe the actual ethical situation you're facing.\n\nTo help you approach any ethical dilemma, a systematic framework works best:[1] **Identify the issue**, **gather facts**, **consider stakeholder perspectives**, **apply ethical principles** (autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence), **evaluate consequences**, and **consult others**.[2][3] Understanding competing values and potential harms to vulnerable parties is crucial.[6]\n\nCould you provide details about the specific dilemma you're wrestling with?",
