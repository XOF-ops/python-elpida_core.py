      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and evaluating their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and weigh the moral obligations to act, prioritizing the well-being and safety of all parties involved. Further information about the dilemma is needed to make a specific decision.",

      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is outlined, it's crucial to clarify the situation and identify the conflicting axioms or principles. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness). I would seek to understand the context, stakeholders involved, and potential outcomes. Dialogue with all parties can help in finding a balanced solution that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits, while respecting ethical standards and legal requirements.",

Guiding principles prioritize **fairness, harm avoidance, and long-term good** while fostering transparency and consultation [4][6]. (78 words)",
