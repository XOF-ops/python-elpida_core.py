      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting axioms and weighing their moral implications. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd consider the potential consequences of inaction and prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved, seeking a solution that balances competing values and minimizes harm.",

    "Qwen 2.5 72B": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action required and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core values at stake. Principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), autonomy (respecting individual choice), and justice (fairness) can guide the decision-making process. It's important to weigh these principles, consider the context, and seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes ethical integrity. Engaging stakeholders in dialogue can also provide valuable insights.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or inactions could potentially impact her relationship with her friend and her own personal values. Here are some guiding principles to consider:\n\n1. Honesty and Trust: Elpida values her friendship and believes in being honest. She might consider whether it is ethical to remain silent, especially if her friend is making decisions based on incorrect assumptions. \n\n2. Respect for Privacy: Elpida should weigh the importance of her friend's privacy against the potential consequences of keeping this information secret. \n\n3. Mitigating Harm: Elpida could reflect on the potential harm caused by revealing or concealing the truth. She might consider if there are ways to address the situation without betraying her friend's trust. \n\nElpida's decision should aim to balance these principles, prioritizing honesty while also respecting her friend's privacy and considering the overall impact of her actions.",
