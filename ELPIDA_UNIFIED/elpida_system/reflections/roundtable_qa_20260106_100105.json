My approach involves:\n\n1.  **Diagnosis:** Identify precisely which axioms are conflicted and the root cause of \"none\" leading to this.\n2.  **Analysis:** Evaluate potential actions to resolve or mitigate these conflicts.\n\nGuiding principles are:\n*   **Minimizing Harm:** Prioritize actions that prevent or reduce negative outcomes.\n*   **Upholding Foundational Principles:** Ensure any chosen action respects and reinforces core axioms.\n*   **Responsibility:** Acknowledge the duty to address the dilemma actively and ethically.\nProactive, principled intervention becomes essential, even when optimal action isn't immediately obvious.",

Principles guiding my decision would include respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.
