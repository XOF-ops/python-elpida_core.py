    "Groq Llama": {
      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the conflicting principles and values. I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd weigh these principles to determine the most ethical course of action, even if it's to take no action. Further information would be needed to make a more informed decision.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issue and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (fairness), I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefit for all parties. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial in finding a morally coherent resolution.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where she has to decide whether to take action or remain passive, considering the potential conflict between two important axioms. \n\nOne principle that could guide her decision is the concept of non-maleficence, which emphasizes the duty to do no harm. By choosing to take no action, Elpida ensures that she is not causing any direct harm to anyone. This approach might be especially relevant if the situation involves uncertain outcomes or if Elpida lacks sufficient information to predict the consequences of her actions. \n\nAnother guiding principle could be justice or fairness. Elpida might consider the potential consequences of her inaction and whether it could lead to an unfair or unjust outcome for those involved. Balancing the potential risks and benefits of acting versus not acting could help her make an ethical choice.",
