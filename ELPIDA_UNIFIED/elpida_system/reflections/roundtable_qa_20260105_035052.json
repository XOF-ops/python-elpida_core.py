      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action or details, I'd approach the dilemma by gathering context and identifying key stakeholders. I'd apply principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), autonomy (respect individual rights), and justice (fairness) to guide my decision, weighing potential consequences and considering multiple perspectives.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and axioms conflict, it's crucial to assess the underlying values and potential consequences of inaction. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm), beneficence (do good), and respect for autonomy, one must consider if inaction could lead to harm or if it respects individual rights and promotes the greater good. The context and specific details of the dilemma are essential for a nuanced decision, ensuring that the chosen path aligns with ethical standards and maximizes positive outcomes.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially result in a conflict with her personal values or ethical principles. While the specific details are not provided, the mention of \"none\" as the action and the existence of axiom conflicts indicate a complex situation. \n\nTo navigate this dilemma, Elpida should consider the following principles:\n\n1. **Clarity and Understanding**: Elpida should seek to fully comprehend the consequences of her actions or inaction. She must gather all relevant information to make an informed decision.\n\n2. **Consistency**: Elpida's decision should align with her personal moral framework and values. Consistency in applying ethical principles is crucial to maintain integrity.\n\n3. **Minimizing Harm**: Elpida should aim to minimize potential harm, especially if her actions might impact others. Balancing the consequences and choosing the lesser of two evils may be necessary.",
