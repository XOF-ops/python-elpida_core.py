      "success": true,
      "response": "Given no action and axiom conflicts, I'd approach the dilemma by identifying the conflicting principles and weighing their moral implications. I'd consider the context, stakeholders, and potential consequences. Guiding principles would include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I'd strive to find a balance that minimizes harm and promotes the greater good.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma with no specific action and conflicting axioms, the first step is to clarify the core issues and stakeholders involved. Guided by principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairness), and respect for autonomy, I would seek a balanced approach that minimizes harm and maximizes benefits. Transparency and stakeholder engagement are crucial in navigating such complexities.",

Without these details, I cannot provide targeted guidance.\n\nHowever, a **systematic ethical decision-making approach** typically involves:\n\n1. **Identify** the ethical issue and conflicting principles[1]\n2. **Gather** relevant facts and stakeholder perspectives[2]\n3. **Apply** ethical frameworks (utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics)[3]\n4. **Evaluate** consequences and alignment with core values[6]\n5. **Consult** with others before deciding[6]\n6. **Implement** transparently and monitor outcomes[1]\n\nPlease share the specific dilemma details so I can offer more relevant guidance.",
