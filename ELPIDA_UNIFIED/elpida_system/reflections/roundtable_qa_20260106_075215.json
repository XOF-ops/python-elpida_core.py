      "success": true,
      "response": "I would analyze the situation, identifying key stakeholders and their interests. Guiding principles include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence (do no harm), and beneficence (do good). I would weigh potential consequences of inaction against possible outcomes of intervention, considering long-term effects and moral implications. Ultimately, I would choose the course of action that minimizes harm and promotes the well-being of all parties involved.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "In addressing ethical dilemmas, especially when no specific action is taken (Action: None), the guiding principles include non-maleficence (do no harm), respect for autonomy, and justice. The lack of action must be evaluated against these to ensure it does not inadvertently cause harm, respects all parties' rights and choices, and remains fair. If inaction is chosen, it should be because it aligns with these ethical principles or because the potential actions have more significant negative consequences. Transparency and accountability in the reasoning behind inaction are also crucial.",

Your query references \"ELPIDA\" and mentions \"Action: None\" and \"Axiom Conflicts,\" but doesn't describe the actual ethical situation you're facing.\n\nTo apply ethical decision-making frameworks effectively, I would need you to:\n\n1. **Describe the specific dilemma** - What is the ethical problem or conflict?\n2. **Identify stakeholders** - Who is affected by this decision?\n3. **Clarify the conflicting values** - What principles or interests are in tension?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can guide you through established frameworks like **identifying the issue, gathering facts, evaluating alternatives, and assessing consequences**[1][2][3] while considering principles like autonomy, justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence[3].\n\nCould you share the specific ethical dilemma you're facing?",
