      "success": true,
      "response": "I'd approach this dilemma by identifying the underlying values and principles at stake. Since there's no action or context provided, I'd consider general ethical principles such as respect, fairness, and non-maleficence (do no harm). I'd weigh potential consequences and prioritize the well-being and dignity of all parties involved, seeking a decision that balances competing interests and promotes the greater good.",

Guiding principles include fairness, harm avoidance, and promoting well-being, prioritizing dialogue for balanced decisions [2][7]. (78 words)",
