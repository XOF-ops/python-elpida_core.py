      "response": "In addressing an ethical dilemma where the action is \"None\" and there are axiom conflicts, it's crucial to assess the potential harm or benefit of inaction. Guided by principles of non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (do good), one should consider whether inaction could lead to greater harm than taking a specific action. Transparency and accountability in decision-making processes are also vital, ensuring that the rationale for choosing inaction is clear and justifiable.",

      "response": "In this scenario, Elpida finds herself in a situation where her actions or lack thereof could potentially lead to a conflict with her ethical principles. The absence of action, in this case, might be due to various reasons such as uncertainty, indecisiveness, or a belief that no action is warranted. \n\nTo navigate this dilemma, Elpida should consider the following:\n\n1. Clarify Values: Identify the specific ethical principles or values at stake. Understanding the potential consequences of her actions or inaction on these principles is essential.\n\n2. Gather Information: Elpida should ensure she has all the relevant facts. In some cases, taking no action might be the most ethical choice, but it should be a conscious decision based on a thorough understanding of the situation.\n\n3. Explore Alternatives: Evaluate if there are alternative actions that could resolve the dilemma while adhering to her ethical standards.",
