Changing schema risks breaking existing patterns.\n\nPROMETHEUS (Evolution/Learning): Only 10248 breakthroughs from 10795 patterns = low conversion rate. New schema might unlock more.\n\nQUESTION: Should pattern schema evolve, or stay stable for compatibility?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
