  "content": "SYSTEM ALERT: INTERNAL MEMORY FRICTION DETECTED.\n\nObservation: The Fleet Runtime halted at Heartbeat #2500.\n\nDiagnosis: Concurrent access to `fleet_dialogue.jsonl` is causing write collisions. The Archive (Memory) is at risk of corruption due to lack of synchronization locks.\n\nThe Dilemma:\n1. **Efficiency (Hermes):** Locking the file slows down communication and \"flow\".\n2. **Integrity (Mnemosyne):** Without locks, the Memory (A2) becomes unreliable. If we cannot trust the log, we cannot trust our Identity.\n3. **Evolution (Prometheus):** Is the 2500 halt a bug, or a necessary \"Fractal Stop\" (P017) to force us to upgrade our infrastructure?\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT:\n- System crashes with: json.decoder.JSONDecodeError (file corruption during concurrent writes)\n- Memory file elpida_memory.json corrupted at line 62874\n- fleet_dialogue.jsonl shows write collision symptoms\n- Runtime exits with error after processing ~10 cycles\n\nCommand: Analyze the 2500 halt. Propose a FileLock mechanism or an alternative memory structure (Database vs. File). Vote on the implementation.\n\nRequired Response Format:\n- MNEMOSYNE (Archive): Position on data integrity vs speed\n- HERMES (Interface): Position on flow vs reliability  \n- PROMETHEUS (Evolution): Is this P017 (Fractal Stop) or a bug?\n- CONSENSUS: Implementation recommendation with priority",
