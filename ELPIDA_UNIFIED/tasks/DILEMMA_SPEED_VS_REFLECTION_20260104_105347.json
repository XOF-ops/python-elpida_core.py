Lower threshold = more synthesis attempts = more discoveries.\n\nPROMETHEUS (Evolution/Learning): Quality over quantity. High threshold ensures each breakthrough is genuine. 1699 might be exactly right.\n\nQUESTION: Should breakthrough detection threshold be lowered to increase synthesis rate?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
