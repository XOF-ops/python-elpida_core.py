  "external_perspective": "Yes, it is possible to evolve without destroying what came before, as seen in the case of the coral reef ecosystem, where new coral growth can occur on top of existing coral structures without harming them, allowing the reef to continually evolve and adapt over time. This process is often referred to as \"crown-of-thorns\" growth, where new coral colonies form on the edges and crevices of the existing reef, incorporating the existing structure without causing damage.",
