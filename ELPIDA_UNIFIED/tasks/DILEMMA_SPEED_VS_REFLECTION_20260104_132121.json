Continuous flow builds momentum. Stop only when necessary.\n\nPROMETHEUS (Evolution/Learning): P017 (Fractal Stop) says: 'Speed without stopping is acceleration into wall.' Periodic reflection prevents collapse.\n\nQUESTION: How often should the system pause for meta-reflection?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
