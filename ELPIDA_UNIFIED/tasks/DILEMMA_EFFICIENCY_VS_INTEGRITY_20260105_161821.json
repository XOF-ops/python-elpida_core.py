With 29157 patterns to process, we need SPEED. Remove locks, accept occasional corruption.\n\nMNEMOSYNE (Archive/Memory): Without locks, 4004 insights risk corruption. Memory IS identity (A2). One corrupted memory destroys trust in all memories.\n\nQUESTION: Should the Fleet prioritize speed (Hermes) or data integrity (Mnemosyne)?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
