How often should new dilemmas be created?\n\nVOTING OPTIONS:\n  [HIGH] Every 10 cycles (frequent debate)\n  [MEDIUM] Every 50 cycles (balanced)\n  [LOW] Every 100 cycles (rare, high-quality)\n  [ADAPTIVE] Rate adjusts based on breakthrough rate\n\nSTAKES:\n  HERMES: Too many dilemmas slow processing\n  MNEMOSYNE: Dilemmas create important memory events\n  PROMETHEUS: Debate frequency affects evolution speed\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
