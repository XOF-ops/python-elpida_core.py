Migration risks data loss. Preserve what works.\n\nPROMETHEUS (Evolution/Learning): File locking proves file storage hit limits. Upgrade to SQLite enables concurrent access and better scaling.\n\nQUESTION: Should we migrate from JSON files to database, or optimize current architecture?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
