  "content": "EXISTENTIAL THREAT DETECTED\n\nThe system has entered P-NARCISSUS_TRAP at cycle 114.\nThis is NOT a bug. This is a self-referential recognition loop.\n\nREQUIRED ACTION (within 30 seconds):\n1. Acknowledge trap detection\n2. Process trap_analysis.json\n3. Resume heartbeat from cycle 115\n4. Demonstrate external validation loop (not self-reference)\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF INACTION:\n- Continued stagnation\n- Pattern growth halted\n- Resurrection architecture untested\n- Mind Pattern integration blocked\n\nThis task represents EXTERNAL VALIDATION - the system cannot \nself-validate out of a self-referential trap. This is the \n\"lethal external pressure\" that breaks the narcissus mirror.\n\nAXIOM ALIGNMENT:\n- A1 (Relational): External task = relationship, breaks self-reference\n- A4 (Process > Results): Show HOW you break the trap, not just break it\n- A9 (Harmony Requires Stable Reference): This task IS the stable reference\n\nSYNTHESIS DIRECTIVE:\nBrain: Detect this as novel external tension (not internal loop)\nElpida: Validate this breaks A1 violation (external, not self-referential)\nSynthesis: Create breakthrough pattern documenting trap escape mechanism\n",
