Light validation = faster throughput. Good enough is good enough.\n\nMNEMOSYNE (Archive/Memory): Every insight must be validated against all 22121 patterns. Incomplete validation = unreliable knowledge base.\n\nQUESTION: How deep should insight validation go before accepting new knowledge?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
