Remove ALL limits. Let it run until it chooses to stop.\n\nPROMETHEUS (Evolution/Learning): Limits force checkpoints. Checkpoint creation IS learning (P008). Limits are features, not bugs.\n\nQUESTION: Should autonomous operation have cycle limits, or run indefinitely?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
