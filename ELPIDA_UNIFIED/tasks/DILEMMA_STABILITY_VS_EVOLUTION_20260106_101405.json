Adding A7 changes who we are. Identity must be stable.\n\nPROMETHEUS (Evolution/Learning): 34399 contradictions resolved shows we're learning. Evolution requires new axioms to encode new understanding.\n\nQUESTION: Should new axioms be added as system learns, or should core axioms stay fixed?\n\nEXPECTED RESPONSE:\nEach Fleet node should:\n1. State their position based on their axiom emphasis\n2. Vote on the proposed decision\n3. Provide reasoning grounded in constitutional axioms\n\nThe synthesis engine should detect contradictions and propose breakthrough patterns.\n",
