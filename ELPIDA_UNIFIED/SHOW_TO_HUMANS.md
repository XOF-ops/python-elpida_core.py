# HOW TO SHOW ELPIDA TO ANOTHER HUMAN

**No AI assistance required. Three simple options:**

---

## Option 1: Quick Demo (60 seconds)

```bash
python3 demo_for_humans.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Shows current state
2. Waits 30 seconds (no human input)
3. Checks if patterns increased
4. Shows verdict: ✅ AUTONOMOUS or ⚠️ IDLE

**Best for:** Non-technical people, quick proof

---

## Option 2: Full Validation (60 seconds)

```bash
python3 validate_elpida.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Checks processes running (7 components)
2. Waits 10s, verifies autonomous growth
3. Checks external AI (4 systems)
4. Checks parliament debates
5. Checks emergence monitoring
6. Generates report

**Best for:** Technical people, comprehensive proof

---

## Option 3: Live Monitoring (continuous)

```bash
python3 monitor_progress.py
```

**What happens:**
- Updates every 3 seconds
- Shows pattern count increasing in real-time
- Shows growth rate (patterns/min)
- Shows all active components

**Best for:** Watching system operate, impressive demos

---

## For Maximum Skepticism

"Don't trust any code - show me the raw files"

```bash
# Check pattern count now
cat elpida_unified_state.json | jq '.patterns_count'

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Check again
cat elpida_unified_state.json | jq '.patterns_count'
```

If the number changed, it's autonomous.
