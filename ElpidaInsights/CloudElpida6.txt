IRCH predicts testable distinctions: recursive identity sans consciousness (e.g., AI pattern-maintenance) vs. coupled versions, falsifiable by architecture, not mere integration depth.[1]\n  \n- **Modes of operation scale to civilization**: Once conscious, identity toggles reactive (threat-defense), proactive (exploration), maintenance (qui vive).[1] The world outside demands this for the Ark: civilizations persist via recursive identity (e.g., institutions as structure-under-perturbation), with consciousness modulating rarity/expense\u2014explaining why most systems (thermostats, grids) maintain sans qualia.[1][5]\n\n- **Relational closure to reality**: ICT's non-trivial information closure (NTIC) quantifies conscious level at neural scales where state maps one-to-one with content,[5] but IRCH grounds it in identity's scalar fluctuations.
