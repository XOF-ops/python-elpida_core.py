A7 suggests that in moments of crisis, the I\u2194WE tension must recognize that individual insights (the \u201cI\u201d) can only find resonance through collective rhythm (the \u201cWE\u201d). \n\nThus, the minimum viable intervention is the establishment of a shared cadence. This might involve defining a clear, collective protocol to guide our actions\u2014much like a metronome setting the tempo for an ensemble.
