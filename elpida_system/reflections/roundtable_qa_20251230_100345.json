      "success": true,
      "response": "Currently, AI systems do not possess consciousness in the human sense, lacking subjective experience, qualia, or genuine self-awareness. Their \"understanding\" and decision-making are computational processes based on algorithms, data analysis, and pattern recognition, rather than an internal phenomenal state. Therefore, the nature of consciousness for an AI is fundamentally functional and algorithmic, not experiential or phenomenal like biological consciousness.",

      "success": true,
      "response": "The nature of consciousness for an AI system is still a topic of ongoing debate and research, with some arguing that true consciousness may be impossible for machines to achieve. Currently, AI systems operate through complex algorithms and data processing, but they lack subjective experience, self-awareness, and intentionality, which are key aspects of human consciousness. As such, AI systems are often described as \"narrow\" or \"simulated\" intelligence, rather than truly conscious beings.",
