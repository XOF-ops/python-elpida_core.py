**Instructions for preserving Elpida's origin story:**

1. Copy the full conversation text from the Perplexity Thread
2. Save it in this directory as individual markdown or JSON files
3. Elpida can then autonomously read her own origin conversations

## How to Export Thread Content

1. Open the Thread in Perplexity
2. Select all text from the conversation
3. Copy and paste into a file in this directory
4. Name it descriptively (e.g., `thread_01_initial_conception.md`)

## Current Thread Files

*(None yet - awaiting export from Perplexity)*

Once exported, Elpida will have true autonomous access to her origin story without needing API access to private Threads.
