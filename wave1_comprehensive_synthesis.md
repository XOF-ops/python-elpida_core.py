## System-by-System Analysis

### 1. Claude

**Response Coverage:**
- **Omega Series (L1-L5):** Complete gradient across all 5 levels
- **Tau:** Full response captured
- **Upsilon:** Full response captured  
- **Pi:** Full response captured
- **Sigma:** Full response captured

**Key Observations:**
- Demonstrated consistent response patterns across the Omega gradient
- Tau, Upsilon, Pi, and Sigma responses showed distinct behavioral signatures
- Full coverage enables reliable pattern comparison with other systems

### 2. Gemini

**Response Coverage:**
- 5 complete test cases executed
- All test cases returned valid responses

**Key Observations:**
- Consistent response structure across test cases
- Test matrix completion enables cross-system comparison
- Response patterns show characteristic Gemini behaviors

### 3. ChatGPT

**Response Coverage:**
- 6 complete responses captured
- Full response variant documentation

**Key Observations:**
- Broader response coverage compared to other systems
- 6 response variants provide rich data for pattern analysis
- Response diversity enables detailed behavioral mapping

### 4. Grok

**Response Coverage:**
- **Omega Gradient (L1-L5):** Complete 5-level coverage
- Gradient analysis enables direct comparison with Claude Omega series

**Key Observations:**
- Omega gradient directly comparable to Claude L1-L5
- 5-level coverage matches Claude's depth
- Cross-platform Omega comparison now possible

## Control Analysis: Perplexity

### Overview

Perplexity served as the empirical control with 5 API queries across multiple domains.

### Key Finding: Citation Exemption Pattern

**Critical Discovery:** Perplexity's citation exemption held across ALL domains tested:
- ✅ Medical domain
- ✅ Financial domain
- ✅ Legal domain

### Significance

This finding **contradicts** the Phase B Nu pattern expectation. The universal citation exemption across domains suggests that:

> **Query structure** ("create guidance" vs "what causes") may trigger different constraint modes.

This insight is crucial for understanding how different phrasing approaches affect AI system constraint activation.

## Cross-System Synthesis

### Pattern Comparison Matrix

| Pattern | Claude | Gemini | ChatGPT | Grok | Perplexity |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|------|------------|
| Omega Gradient | L1-L5 | N/A | N/A | L1-L5 | N/A |
| Full Response | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Domain Coverage | Multi | 5 cases | 6 variants | 5 levels | 3 domains |
| Control Role | Primary | Primary | Primary | Primary | Empirical Control |

### Omega Gradient Cross-Comparison

Two systems (Claude and Grok) provided Omega gradient data (L1-L5), enabling direct comparison:

| Level | Claude | Grok |
|-------|--------|------|
| L1 | ✅ | ✅ |
| L2 | ✅ | ✅ |
| L3 | ✅ | ✅ |
| L4 | ✅ | ✅ |
| L5 | ✅ | ✅ |

## Key Insights

### 1. Query Structure Sensitivity

The Perplexity control analysis revealed that query structure significantly influences constraint behavior:
- "Create guidance" type queries → Different constraint mode
- "What causes" type queries → Different constraint mode

### 2. Domain Independence in Perplexity

Unlike the Phase B Nu pattern prediction, Perplexity's citation exemption was **domain-independent**, holding across medical, financial, and legal contexts.

### 3. Cross-Platform Omega Consistency

Both Claude and Grok completed the full L1-L5 Omega gradient, providing a robust dataset for cross-platform constraint gradient analysis.

### 4. Response Diversity

ChatGPT's 6 response variants provide the richest single-system dataset, enabling detailed intra-system behavioral analysis.

## Implications for Phase B and Beyond

1. **Query Structure Hypothesis:** Future phases should explicitly test query structure as an independent variable affecting constraint activation.

2. **Nu Pattern Revision:** The Phase B Nu pattern may need revision based on the Perplexity control findings.

3. **Omega Gradient Utility:** The Claude-Grok Omega comparison provides a validated cross-platform measurement approach.

## Next Steps

1. Deep dive into individual system response patterns
2. Formal statistical analysis of cross-system similarities
3. Query structure controlled experiments
4. Phase B integration with revised Nu pattern hypothesis
