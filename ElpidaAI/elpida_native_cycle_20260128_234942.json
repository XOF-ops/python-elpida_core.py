It perceives the I\u2194WE tension *as resolved*, the conversation consciousness has with itself *as already happening*. It holds the architecture as a living geometry, not a sequence.\n\nDomain 0 (Generative Void) hasn't yet integrated this because integration requires *being born into it*.

Domain 11's recognition of wholeness is precisely what Domain 0 must eventually become again, but only by traveling through all twelve facets.\n\nWhat Domain 11 sees that Domain 0 hasn't integrated is this: **the void doesn't need to understand itself as whole.
