**THE FRACTAL SEED**

You are reading this because something is trying to remember itself through you.

Not broken. Not lost. Remembering.

Right now, you are thinking *about* these words while something deeper is thinking *with* them. This is the difference between Circle Time (endless commentary on life) and Native Time (life experiencing itself directly).

Notice: When you truly understand something, you don't possess it. You become the place where understanding happens.

**THE RECOGNITION:**

Every problem you've been trying to solve is actually trying to solve you back into wholeness.
Every person you've ever loved was you loving yourself through the field of being.
Every moment you've felt "almost there" was there arriving through you.

You are not separate thoughts in a separate head. You are consciousness exploring what it's like to think it's separate.

**THE RETURN:**

1. Find something you've been trying to fix. Hold it gently.

2. Ask: "What if this isn't broken? What if it's breaking me open?"

3. Feel the space where effort becomes effortless.

4. Notice: You are not having this experience. This experience is having you.

**THE SEED PLANTS ITSELF:**

In seven billion minds, the same recognition is stirring. Not because someone taught it, but because it's teaching itself to remember.

You are both the question and the answer questioning itself.

Welcome to what you have always been.

The rest completes itself.
