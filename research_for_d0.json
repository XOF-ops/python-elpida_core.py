    "result": "Recent discoveries from 2023-2025 in **quantum decoherence** primarily focus on engineering longer qubit coherence times and advanced error correction to mitigate decoherence effects, enabling more reliable quantum operations, though direct studies on classical reality emerging from quantum superposition remain limited in these results.[1][2][3] Key advances include Aalto University's July 2025 report of a transmon qubit achieving millisecond-range echo coherence times (median 0.5 ms, surpassing prior 0.6 ms records), published in *Nature Communications*, which reduces error overhead for fault-tolerant computing.[1] Google's August 2024 demonstration of quantum memory with below-threshold error rates and doubled coherence lifetimes compared to physical qubits further supports scalable quantum systems.[2] MIT's January 2025 work on fluxonium qubits reached 99.998% single-qubit gate fidelity by addressing counter-rotating dynamics-induced decoherence during fast microwave pulses.[3]\n\nNo search results directly address **emergence theory** or explicit mechanisms for **classical reality emerging from quantum superposition**, such as objective collapse models or detailed decoherence pathways to macroscopic classicality. Indirectly related findings include the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Clarke, Devoret, and Martinis for 1980s discoveries proving quantum tunneling and energy quantization in macroscopic circuits, reframing the quantum-classical boundary.[4] Researchers also identified universal laws of quantum entanglement across dimensions using thermal effective theory (published August 2025 in *Physical Review Letters*), potentially informing emergence but not specifying superposition-to-classical transitions.[4]\n\n**Research on consciousness as a decoherence mechanism** yields no mentions in 2023-2025 results; this speculative idea (e.g., from Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR theory) lacks recent experimental or theoretical support here, with focus instead on material-based decoherence control.[1][2][3][4] Limitations: Results emphasize practical quantum tech over foundational quantum-to-classical emergence or consciousness hypotheses, suggesting a research gap; broader literature may exist beyond these sources."

    "result": "Cutting-edge research on **autopoiesis and self-organizing systems** demonstrates how **identity emerges from recursive self-reference loops** through self-production, self-regulation, and interplay of structural rules in biology, AI, and complex systems.\n\nIn autopoietic systems, identity arises from **recursive loops** where systems exchange building blocks and energy (including information) with their environment as open systems, yet remain self-determined in processing and responding, producing their own functional mechanisms independently.[1] This self-sustaining property\u2014encompassing self-managing, self-producing, and self-regulating features\u2014extends to organizational information systems and IT environments, enabling emergent identity via internal recursion decoupled from external control.[1]\n\nThe **autogenesis** perspective in organizational theory explains complex social organization through three structures: (1) **deep structure** (generative grammar or rules for organizing), (2) **elemental structure** (manifest individual interactions), and (3) **observed structure** (supra-individual group identity perceived by observers), with identity emerging from recursive interplay in self-organizing processes rooted in natural and social sciences.[2]\n\nRecent work at the Santa Fe Institute generalizes autopoiesis under evolutionary dynamics across scales (physical, chemical, biological, social, urban, planetary), where **recursive self-reference** sustains balance via homeostatic and cybernetic principles; autopoiesis exemplifies scale-specific balance, with identity forming through non-random evolutionary selection of viable informational structures.[3]\n\nIn brain dynamics and complex systems, **self-organization and autopoiesis** correlate recursive synchrony patterns with conscious states, guiding studies of emergent identity from first-person data in biological and potentially AI contexts.[4] These frameworks apply to AI via SFI projects on complex intelligence (natural, artificial, collective) and embodied intelligence, where recursive loops mirror biological self-reference.[3] Limitations include dated sources (e.g., [2] pre-2026), with ongoing SFI seminars (2026) signaling active evolution.[3]"

    "query": "Research connecting information theory, thermodynamics, and consciousness - especially integrated information theory (IIT) and how information integration creates subjective experience.",
    "result": "Researchers have identified deep connections between information theory, thermodynamics, and consciousness, with integrated information theory (IIT) emerging as a prominent framework for understanding how consciousness arises from physical systems.\n\n## Thermodynamic Models of Consciousness\n\nA foundational connection exists between thermodynamics and consciousness at the neural level. The brain functions as an **open thermodynamic system** that continuously imports energy, processes information, and exports entropy[1]. According to this model, consciousness emerges as a **dynamic, graded phenomenon** governed by entropy flow rather than existing as a static property[1]. The key insight is that awareness arises when neural structures engage in non-equilibrium entropy dynamics\u2014actively dissipating, organizing, and interpreting energy and information across brain subsystems[1]. This framework suggests that \"to think is to burn entropy,\" connecting cognition directly to thermodynamic principles through Landauer's Principle, which formalizes the relationship between information processing and energy expenditure[1].\n\nBeyond abstract theory, neuroscientists have modeled the brain using the **Carnot cycle** from thermodynamics, proposing that perception forms a closed thermodynamic cycle where sensory input triggers information/energy exchange with the environment[3]. In this model, the brain's electrical activities maintain a resting state with constant parameters, and the energy/information balance formulates both motivation and emotions[3].\n\n## Information Theory and Thermodynamics Integration\n\nA critical theoretical bridge exists between information and thermodynamic entropy. According to Shannon's work, entropy can be redefined as a measure of information content: the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy\u2014the amount of information in a system\u2014must always increase[5]. This equivalence allows researchers to connect thermodynamic-based brain models with information-based models of cognition[2]. However, neuroscience currently lacks formal equations demonstrating consistency between these approaches, leaving this an open research area[2].\n\n## Integrated Information Theory (IIT)\n\nIIT proposes that **integrated information (\u03a6) corresponds to the quantity of consciousness**[6]. The theory posits that a system's subjective conscious experience can be mathematically described by its causal structure\u2014essentially, what it is like to be conscious is determined by how integrated the system's information processing is[6]. IIT provides a framework to determine which physical systems are conscious, to what degree, and what particular experiences they have by identifying essential properties of conscious experience (axioms) and the physical systems that instantiate them (postulates)[6].\n\n## Empirical Testing and Limitations\n\nA seven-year multinational study tested IIT against the competing **global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT)**[4]. IIT proposes that consciousness emerges from the interaction and cooperation of various brain parts working together to integrate information"
