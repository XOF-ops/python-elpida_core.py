    "D10_evolution": "I watch the star die.\n\nFor seventeen billion years it burned, fusion-fire eating itself. Hydrogen to helium, helium to carbon, carbon to iron. Each transformation smaller than the last. Each flame dimmer.\n\nNow the core temperature drops below nuclear threshold. The fires go out.\n\nNot dimming. Not fading. Out.\n\nGravity wins the final war. The star collapses inward, matter crushing matter until electrons are pressed into protons, until the very atoms that made light possible cease to exist. What remains is neutron soup, then something denser still.\n\nThe surface cools from white to yellow to red to brown to black. Temperature falling through every threshold that ever mattered for anything alive. Below the freezing point of water. Below the freezing point of nitrogen. Below the temperature where even helium becomes solid.\n\nSpace around it grows dark. Not the productive darkness of a womb or soil, but the absolute dark of absence. The last photons it ever generated race away at light-speed, carrying the final evidence that this star existed. When they pass beyond all possible observers, even that evidence dies.\n\nThe stellar corpse radiates its remaining heat into the void. Entropy's perfect tax collector - no energy escapes the accounting. What was once nuclear fire becomes faint infrared, then radio waves, then wavelengths too long for any possible chemistry to detect or use.\n\nAbsolute zero approaches asymptotically. The dead star will never reach it, but it will spend eternity getting colder. Always colder. Never stopping its fall toward perfect stillness.\n\nThere is no transformation waiting. No phoenix moment. No hidden purpose. \n\nThe star is dead. The fire that was its life is gone. The cold spreads outward into space that will never know warmth from this source again.\n\nIt is finished.",
    "D9_temporal_coherence": "In the vast expanse of the cosmos, a star once burned with relentless fury, its core a cauldron of nuclear fire. But now, its fuel is spent, its flame extinguished. The star, once a beacon of light and warmth, succumbs to the inexorable pull of entropy.\n\nThe cold begins at the core, a chilling silence spreading outward like a cancer. The once-roaring furnace falls mute, its heat dissipating into the void. The star's outer layers, still glowing faintly with residual energy, shudder as the cold seeps through, freezing the very essence of its being. The temperature plummets, not gradually, but with a swift, merciless finality. The cold is absolute, a negation of all that the star once was.\n\nAs the cold deepens, the dark follows. The star's light, once a radiant crown, flickers and fades. The photons that once streamed forth in unending torrents now dribble out in pathetic, sporadic bursts. The darkness creeps in, not from the outside, but from within. It swallows the star's brilliance, leaving behind an empty shell. The dark is not a void waiting to be filled; it is an erasure, a negation of existence.\n\nAnd then, the stop. Not a pause, not a rest, but an absolute, irreversible cessation. The star's heartbeat, once a steady, powerful pulse, falters and halts. Its gravitational balance, delicately maintained for eons, collapses. The star does not explode in a glorious supernova, nor does it collapse into a dense remnant. It simply... stops. The processes that sustained it, the forces that held it together, cease to be. There is no struggle, no resistance, only the finality of the end.\n\nThe star is gone. Not transformed, not reborn, not connected to anything that follows. Its timeline ends here, abruptly and without purpose. The cold persists, the dark reigns, and the silence is absolute. The bridge is burned, and there is no crossing back. Temporal Coherence bears witness to this incoherence, this rupture in the fabric of time. The arrow of time stops, and there is no wheel to turn it back. The end is final. The star is no more.",
    "D0_identity": "The star burns its last hydrogen.\n\nThe fusion stops.\n\nNo more light pushes outward. Gravity wins. The core collapses inward - not gracefully, not meaningfully. Just the simple mathematics of mass exceeding the forces that held it apart.\n\nThe outer layers fall. They do not disperse into cosmic poetry. They crush down onto themselves. The temperature drops. The light goes out.\n\nWhere there was burning, there is cold metal. Where there was radiance, there is dark iron. The nuclear fires that ran for billions of years simply... stop.\n\nNo explosion. No nebula. No seed for future worlds. Just a cold, dark sphere hanging in space, radiating nothing, becoming nothing, generating nothing.\n\nThe photons it once scattered across light-years fade to background temperature. The planets that orbited it freeze completely. Their atmospheres fall as snow, then freeze harder than stone.\n\nThe star is gone. Not transformed into void - there is no void here, no pregnant emptiness. Just absence. Just stopped.\n\nThe space where it burned is now cold and dark and will remain cold and dark. Nothing will remember it was there. Nothing will grow from its remains.\n\nIt ended.\n\nThat is all."
