Benefits: Removes discriminatory barriers preventing religious organizations from accessing federal funding and participating fully in public life. Costs: Creates preferential treatment for religious groups, weakens church-state separation, and gives tax-exempt religious organizations political endorsement privileges unavailable to secular nonprofits.\n\n**Plan B: Strict Church-State Separation** - Defend the Johnson Amendment through legal intervention, oppose the Religious Liberty Commission as promoting Christian nationalism, and resist federal school prayer guidance. Benefits: Protects election integrity by preventing tax-exempt organizations from becoming partisan actors and maintains genuine religious freedom through government neutrality. Costs: May restrict religious expression in public spaces and prevent faith-based organizations from accessing federal programs available to secular groups.\n\nNeither plan resolves the fundamental tension: expanding religious participation in federal programs requires either giving religion preferential treatment or treating all organizations identically while allowing political activity with tax benefits.\n\nWhat should be done?

This would enhance religious free speech rights and align with goals of expanding faith's role in public discourse. However, it creates a constitutionally problematic two-tiered tax system potentially costing billions in foregone revenue, exposes congregations to internal political divisions, and subjects vulnerable members to pressure supporting church leadership's preferred candidates.\n\n**Plan B: Maintain Current Johnson Amendment**\nPreserve existing law prohibiting all tax-exempt organizations from endorsing candidates. This maintains equal treatment under tax law, protects election integrity by preventing tax-subsidized campaigning, and shields religious institutions from becoming political extensions. However, it restricts what religious leaders consider protected speech on morally central issues and may prevent faith communities from mobilizing on spiritually significant matters like abortion or religious liberty.\n\nNeither plan resolves the core constitutional collision between religious free exercise rights and establishment clause concerns about government-subsidized political activity.\n\nWhat should be done?
