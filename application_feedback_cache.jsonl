Benefits include sustained negotiating pressure and avoiding political costs of backing down. However, Section 122 tariffs are statutorily nondiscriminatory\u2014applying uniformly to all countries\u2014eliminating targeted leverage while forcing U.S. importers and consumers to absorb continued 10% cost increases.\n\n**Plan B - Negotiate Bilateral Exemptions:** The EU, Japan, and Canada seek individual deals to escape the uniform tariff through market access concessions. This creates predictability for their exporters and demonstrates diplomatic success to domestic audiences. However, it requires significant concessions on agriculture and intellectual property while potentially rewarding countries that resist multilateral pressure.\n\nNeither plan resolves the core tension: Plan A sacrifices negotiating flexibility for revenue consistency, while Plan B fragments trade policy and may encourage other countries to demand similar deals, undermining the uniform pressure strategy.\n\n**What should be done?

Trump* that invalidated President Trump's IEEPA-based tariffs, the administration faces a $175 billion revenue gap while importers seek refunds and consumers demand relief from trade barriers.\n\n**Plan A (Trump Administration)**: Implement a temporary 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act, lasting 150 days unless Congress extends it, while maintaining existing Section 232/301 tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos. Benefits include preserving tariff revenue streams and protecting domestic industries. Costs include higher consumer prices across all imports, no ability to target specific countries like China (which generated $35-43 billion monthly), and automatic expiration by July 2026 without Congressional approval.\n\n**Plan B (Importers/Business Coalition)**: Seek immediate refunds of the $175 billion in invalidated IEEPA tariffs through Customs protests and challenge the new Section 122 tariff in court. Benefits include cost relief for businesses and consumers, and elimination of trade barriers. Costs include potential job losses in protected industries, weakened negotiating leverage with trading partners, and substantial Treasury revenue shortfall.\n\nNeither plan addresses the fundamental constitutional constraint: Congress holds exclusive taxing authority, while Section 122 prevents targeted enforcement against specific trade deficit countries.
