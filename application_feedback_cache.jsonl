The center favors minimal intervention while states like Rajasthan and Karnataka have created fragmented welfare boards covering only 200,000 workers.\n\n**Plan A (Central Enumeration)**: National worker registration with voluntary platform guidelines costs \u20b9500 crore initially, preserves \u20b910 billion annual FDI, and provides basic identity cards to 15 million current workers by 2027. However, this leaves 80% without insurance coverage amid 15% annual increases in workplace accidents, as platforms continue externalizing labor costs.\n\n**Plan B (State Welfare Boards)**: Mandatory platform contributions (1-2% of commissions) funding comprehensive welfare boards would cost \u20b95,000 crore annually but provide accident insurance and pensions nationwide. Rajasthan's board processed 50,000 claims in 2024-2025. Yet this approach risks platform relocation to less regulated states and creates enforcement gaps across India's concurrent labor jurisdiction.\n\nNeither plan addresses the core challenge: platforms' corporate structure limits state fiscal levers without employment reclassification, while fragmented implementation enables venue-shopping and regulatory arbitrage across 28 states.\n\n**What should be done?

The Massachusetts State Legislature faces a January 30, 2026 federal funding deadline that ties HUD grants to housing production progress.\n\n**Plan A: State-level \"Block Zoning Amnesty\"** would invalidate zoning restrictions on any city block where 25% of buildings are noncompliant, enabling redevelopment of 10,000+ structures to add 5,000-10,000 housing units over 3-5 years with 20-30% permitting cost savings and projected 5-10% drop in starter home prices. However, this risks displacing 2,000-5,000 low-income households through gentrification and eliminates local neighborhood control.\n\n**Plan B: Local \"Targeted Compliance Upgrades\"** would retain local zoning authority while using $500 million in federal funds to upgrade 2,000 priority buildings, adding 2,000 units over 5-7 years with 30% affordable set-asides, protecting 15,000 very low-income residents from displacement.
